31286980_26764|a| Not only that, inhibiting COL6A3 expression was related to insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation via suppression of the induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1) [ 14 ]. And COL6A3 was highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tissue. In serum levels, its expression was higher associated with perineural invasion and cigarette smoking. And significantly upregulated expression of multiple genes (including COL6A2, and COL6A3) were found in adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma tumor samples [ 15 ]. Ran Ao et al. reported that silencing of COL6A3 can inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis by the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway [ 16 ]. In addition, COL6A3 played the clinical relevance in the development of colorectal cancer validated by silico analysis of cell type-specific gene expression and COL6A3 knockout experiments [ 17 ]. In the database of UALCAN (<url>) (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2), COL6A3 expression indicated a significant difference between normal lung tissues and lung adenocarcinoma- or lung squamous cell carcinoma tumor-samples. Further, the correlations of survival rates with the expression of COL6A3 in lung cancer illustrated that lung cancer patients with higher COL6A3 expression had a lower survival rates (HR =1.32, 95%CI: 1.11â€“1.58, log-rank p = 0.0018, Additional file 3: Figure S3) shown in the database of Kaplan-Meier Plotter (<url>). Hence, COL6A3 was indeed involved in the process of many cancers.
