31179325_3257|a| As a cardiac- and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-22 has been reported to participate in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling in response to stress [ 11 ]. The miR-132/212 cluster has been confirmed to play a critical role in cardiac hypertrophy [ 12 ]. As a dominant member of the miR-132/212 family, miR-132 negatively regulates cardiac function during cardiac remodeling by inducing angiogenesis. miR-150, a miRNA that is closely associated with inflammation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases [ 13 â€“ 15 ]. miR-150 has been shown to regulate high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by targeting the transcriptional coactivator p300 [ 16 ]. Overall, these studies indicate that all three miRNAs play important roles in various cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, a recent microarray analysis showed that the expression levels of miR-22, miR-132, and miR-150 were obviously dysregulated in patients with AMI [ 10 ]. However, the clinical significance of circulating miR-22-5p, miR-132-5p, and miR-150-3p in patients with AMI remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the dynamic expressions of miR-22-5p, miR-132-5p, and miR-150-3p in plasma obtained from patients in the early phase of AMI and explored the potential diagnostic value of these markers. Our findings suggest that circulating miR-22-5p, miR-132-5p, and miR-150-3p may be promising biomarkers for the early stage of AMI without affected by the affected by heparin or cardiovascular drugs. Furthermore, a composite of these miRNAs may provide superior predictive value.
