30305036_13335|a| In summary, AA amyloidosis can occur in sickle cell disease. This case report highlights several teaching points. This case emphasizes the importance of increased awareness among nephrologists for AA amyloidosis as a cause of proteinuria in sickle cell disease. Nephrotic-range proteinuria is uncommon in sickle cell disease and kidney biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. Sickle cell disease can cause chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, reduced glomerular filtration rate and is associated with increased mortality [ 1 ]. AA amyloidosis in sickle cell disease may be caused by frequent vaso-occlusive crises so their prevention is important. Although unstudied in sickle cell disease with AA amyloidosis per se, ACE inhibition and hydroxyurea decrease proteinuria so they may limit progression of chronic kidney disease [ 8 , 9 ]. Hydroxyurea decreases frequency of vaso-occlusive pain crises so it might be helpful in limiting progression of renal AA amyloidosis. However, further studies are needed to determine optimal treatment strategies for AA amyloidosis in sickle cell disease.
