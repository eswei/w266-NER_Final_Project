30976202_21514|a| For the first time, we revealed a negative correlation between ZEB1 expression and pCR in breast cancer patients receiving NAT. We found that tumors expressing high levels of ZEB1 protein were less likely to achieve pCR after NAT. In the preclinical stage, a study from Zhang reported that ZEB1 was correlated with several chemo-resistant genes, such as ATM, CD4, and PIM3 [ 10 ]. ZEB1 expression was associated with a chemo-resistant tumor phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Others also reported that ZEB1 promoted the DNA damage response and radio-resistance through CHK1 [ 23 ]. All this molecular evidence suggested that ZEB1 was able to undermine the sensitivity of tumors towards cytotoxic therapy, which could explain why it was more difficult for patients with high ZEB1 expression levels to achieve complete remission after NAT compared with patients with low ZEB1 expression levels. Moreover, ZEB1 expression was still a strong indicator of poor survival in breast cancer patients in our study. The fact that ZEB1 promoted EMT and facilitated tumor metastasis is probably the main underlying reason for this result. Our result is supported by research by Lin, which showed that ZEB1 and ZEB2 mRNA expression as well as protein expression were associated with poor survival in breast cancer [ 21 ]. Our result was also supported by Min, who reported that ZEB1 protein expression was associated with poor survival in TNBC [ 24 ]. The predictive role of ZEB1 is also validated in other tumors, such as ovarian carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 25 â€“ 27 ].
