31819514_3225|a| Novel oncogene with kinase domain (NOK), also known as serine threonine tyrosine kinase 1 (STYK1), consists of a kinase domain, intracellular domain, and transmembrane domain. NOK, a member of the receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase-like family, 10 is able to enhance tumor cell proliferation and tumor progression by acting as a growth factor membrane receptor. Aberrant expression of NOK has been found in a wide range of cancers, including lung, ovarian, breast, colorectal, prostate, and renal cell cancers. 11 â€“ 16 Recently, NOK was found to be capable of promoting the malignant transformation of tumors in some cancers by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. 17 , 18 All these studies indicate that NOK overexpression is associated with cancer progression, and NOK can induce EMT by activating the Akt pathway. However, the pathological function of NOK in the malignant transformation of NSCLC remains unknown. In this study, we estimated the NOK expression and its correlation with the Akt pathway and EMT marker expression in NSCLC. Furthermore, we investigated the possible signaling pathways by which NOK could contribute to EMT. These findings may provide a clue to investigate the oncogenic activity of NOK and identify the possible underlying mechanisms of EMT in NSCLC.
