29942926_15496|a| Symptoms developed rapidly in most cases. This ranged from 1 month to 5 years, but those with longer durations had a sudden decline in the last few weeks. This is unlike the insidious onset of other forms of nonectopic Cushing syndrome. The majority of patients had severe Cushingoid symptoms, likely due to the higher levels of ACTH and cortisol [ 5 ]. This also explains the high frequency of hypokalemia seen among these patients; 95% of those who reported a potassium level had hypokalemia. Only two cases reported normal potassium levels. This is much higher than what is found in Cushing disease, where, in one study, the rate of unprovoked hypokalemia was only 10% [ 66 ]. Elevated blood pressure was reported in 96% of cases, one case had hypotension, and another remained well controlled. New or worsening hyperglycemia was reported in 79% of cases. Six cases, including our own, reported weight loss. This finding, in addition to elevated androgen levels, was initially concerning for malignancy. Typical Cushingoid features were absent in three cases despite the elevated cortisol levels. Four cases reported a lack of catecholamine excess, but the pathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. In five more cases, catecholamines were not checked preoperatively despite the presence of an adrenal mass; one of these was found elevated during adrenal venous sampling. In a sixth case, the laboratory was sent for metanephrines, but surgery was done before results were available due to the patientâ€™s clinical decline. Severe intraoperative hypertension was reported in one of these cases. According to the most recent guidelines, pheochromocytoma should be ruled out in any adrenal mass even in the absence of the clinical signs of catecholamine excess [ 67 ].
