31071912_2316|a| Glycosylation is the most complex form of all post-translational modifications (PTMs) and is defined by the regulated process of adding lipids and carbohydrates to proteins, as this regulation depends on enzymes and proteases that allow for the diversification of glycoprotein structure and function [ 3 ]. Several protein glycosylation types are currently known, the major ones representing the N-linked and the O-linked (mucin) glycosylation [ 4 ]. Glycosylation perturbations, including aberrantly glycosylated sugars, affect cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle control [ 5 ]. The most examined type of O-glycosylation is the mucin type, which is mediated by 20 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts) [ 6 ]. Altered expression of O-glycans in cancer is frequently attributed to under- or overexpression of members of the GalNAc-T family [ 7 ]; however, few studies have examined the role of different GalNAc-Ts in EOC. We previously identified the GalNAc-T3 (GALNT3) gene as a potential EOC oncogene, highly expressed in advanced disease, as GALNT3 expression was significantly associated with poor outcome [ 8 ]. We also demonstrated that GALNT3 could contribute to EOC dissemination through the aberrant glycosylation of different O-glycoproteins, including the MUC1 oncogene [ 8 ]. Consecutively, we analyzed alterations in glycoproteinsâ€™ expression following GALNT3 gene knockdown (KD) in EOC cells using a metabolic labeling strategy for enrichment and glycoprotein analysis [ 9 ]. This glycoproteomics approach led to the identification of numerous O-glycoproteins that were differentially expressed upon GALNT3 KD [ 9 ]. Studies on other GalNAc-Ts in EOC were indicative of a role of GALNT14 in promoting EOC cell migration by modulating MUC13 glycosylation [ 10 ], and of a role of GALN6 in modifying EGFR O-glycosylation [ 11 ].
