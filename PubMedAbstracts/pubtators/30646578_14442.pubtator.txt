30646578_14442|a| MTHFR gene polymorphisms cause enzyme thermolability and involve C-to-T substitution at nucleotide 667 and A-to-C at nucleotide 1298; these MTHFR mutations have been associated with homocystinuria, neural tube defects, preeclampsia, cleft lip and cleft palate, cerebrovascular disease, and psychiatric disorders including susceptibility to depression and schizophrenia [ 39 , 40 ]. Population-based international studies showed no increased risk of dementia in subjects with MTHFR polymorphisms [ 41 , 42 ]. In Japan, Nishiyama et al. [ 43 ] found a slight association of the MTHFR-C667T polymorphism with senile cognitive decline in men but not with AD. In Australia, a causal link between high tHcy and incident dementia was demonstrated [ 44 ] but the study lacked power to determine an effect of the MTHFR-C667T genotype. In contrast, de Lau and collaborators [ 45 ] in the normal elderly population of the Rotterdam Study observed that the MTHFR-C665T genotype was associated with elevated tHcy but not with cognitive loss or white matter lesions. In a small patient population in Tunisia [ 46 ], the MTHFR-A1298C mutation was associated with susceptibility to AD. As mentioned earlier, Rom√°n [ 11 ] found a very high frequency (above 90%) of MTHFR gene mutations in an elderly population attending a memory clinic in the USA, with diagnoses ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to LOAD; about 65% had single mutations; the MTHFR-C667T mutation was found in 58.5% of the patients and 41.5% had the MTHFR-A1298C mutation whereas 20% were compound heterozygous for both mutations [ 11 ].
