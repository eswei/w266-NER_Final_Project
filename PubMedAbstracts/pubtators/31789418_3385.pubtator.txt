31789418_3385|a| Homoharringtonine (HHT), a plant alkaloid with antitumor properties, was originally identified nearly 40 years ago ( 15 ), and has been revealed to play an important role in the treatment of CML, both before and after the clinical use of TKIs ( 16 , 17 ). In 2010, the use of HHT for relapsed/refractory CML was approved by the FDA ( 18 ). HHT is an alternative treatment for patients with CML who exhibit resistance or intolerance to TKIs. The drug involves a distinct mechanism and may be able to inhibit leukemic stem cells, which play a key role in the progression of CML ( 19 ). There are different theories regarding the mechanisms of HHT. First, it is widely considered that HHT exerts a role in the treatment of leukemia. This is mainly achieved by inhibiting the synthesis of proteins associated with cell apoptosis and cell survival, such as Mcl-1, XIAP, and Myc ( 20 â€“ 22 ). Recently, it was reported that HHT is involved in other mechanisms. For example, it can regulate alternative splicing of Bcl-x and caspase-9 and regulate Smad3 protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylation ( 23 , 24 ). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of HHT is very complex and has not been fully elucidated yet. In particular, it is unclear as to how HHT regulates the oncoprotein BCR-ABL. Although it has been reported that HHT could downregulate the BCR-ABL protein by inhibiting protein synthesis ( 25 ), it is speculated that there may be more specific mechanisms involved. In the present study, it was reported that HHT promoted oncoprotein BCR-ABL degradation and cell apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant CML K562G cell line, and the p62-mediated autophagy-lysosome pathway was involved in BCR-ABL protein degradation induced by HHT. Depletion of p62 or inhibition of autophagy not only reversed HHT-induced BCR-ABL protein degradation, but also affected cytotoxicity of HHT on CML cells.
