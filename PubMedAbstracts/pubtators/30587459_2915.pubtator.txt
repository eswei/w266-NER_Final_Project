30587459_2915|a| Research in the context Evidence before this study Growing evidence has suggested that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) hold the significant promise for tumor imaging and targeted therapy. The G-protein-coupled receptor sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) has been found to play critical roles in the development and progression of several tumors through interaction with its ligand Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). However, the effects of S1P/S1PR3 axis on osteosarcoma (OS) still remain elusive. Added value of this study This study investigated the expression level, biological function, downstream regulation and clinical impact of S1PR3 on OS. We observed that increased S1PR3 expression predicted poor survival rate in OS patients and promoted cell proliferation by inducing the Warburg effect in OS. In addition, we also found that S1PR3 antagonist TY52156 exhibited the synergistic inhibitory effects with methotrexate on OS cell growth. Mechanistically, we uncovered that S1P/S1PR3 axis promoted the aerobic glycolysis in OS through inhibiting the phosphorylation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) and promoting the nuclear translocation of YAP, which contributed to the formation of the YAPâ€“c-MYC complex and enhanced transcription of the important glycolysis enzyme PGAM1. Implications of all the available evidence Our findings delineated one of the instrumental molecular mechanisms underlying the glucose metabolism reprogram in the OS and indicated that S1P/S1PR3 axis was a potential therapeutic target for patients with OS.
