30186875_19276|a| APN is a multipurpose adipokine which is primarily secreted in adipose tissues and then released into the blood, further exerting antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties. In accordance with a previous study [ 36 ], we confirmed that APN significantly decreases blood glucose compared with the diabetic group, whereas AS had no obvious effect on blood glucose (Figure 3(b)). In addition, APN was reported to block cannabinoid type 1 receptor [ 37 ] and increase free fatty acid Î²-oxidation [ 38 ], therefore ameliorating the fat accumulation in the liver. In another study, the level of APN was found to be negatively related to the progression of NAFLD and may be a potential marker to distinguish different stages of NAFLD [ 9 ]. In this study, the serum APN level and hepatic APN expression were also significantly low in the diabetic group (Figure 7(a) and Table 1). However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. In the present study, we have demonstrated beneficial effects of APN on T1DM-induced NAFLD and explored its molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that APN inhibited T1DM-induced NAFLD via reduction of the expression of FoxO1. Moreover, Akt1 signaling may represent a mechanism by which APN mediated the suppression of FoxO1 in T1DM-induced NAFLD (Figure 7).
