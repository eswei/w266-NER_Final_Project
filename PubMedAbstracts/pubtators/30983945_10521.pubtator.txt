30983945_10521|a| Controversial results were reported concerning the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of visfatin concentrations. For example, Caix√†s et al.[ 17 ] investigated the change of visfatin concentrations in hyperthyroid patients before and after treatment. The results showed plasma visfatin tended to be higher in hyperthyroid patients than in controls. After normalization of thyroid function, plasma visfatin increased and was higher than those of the controls. Similarly, Chu et al.[ 16 ] found that visfatin concentrations were higher in patients with hyperthyroidism compared with controls. In addition, they found a positive correlation between visfatin concentration and thyroid hormones, including T3 and T4. The authors suggested that the higher concentrations in hyperthyroid patients may reflect a state of visfatin resistance. In contrast, we observed, in the present study, lower serum visfatin levels in hyperthyroid patients than in controls. Moreover, visfatin levels were positively correlated with TSH and negatively correlated with FT4 and TT4. A similar observation was reported by Ozkaya et al.[ 18 ] who found that patients with hyperthyroidism had lower concentrations of visfatin than the control group. Furthermore, visfatin was positively correlated with TSH and inversely correlated with FT3 and FT4. This could be explained by the findings of McLaren et al.[ 25 ] who reported that T3 could induce a downregulation of visfatin mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Abdelsalam and Edrees[ 7 ] reported a similar lowering of serum visfatin in experimentally-induced hyperthyroid rats. Such discrepancies between study results could be explained by different patient characteristics, coexisting autoimmunity, and methodological factors.
