31818312_77604|a| Enhanced invasiveness and metastatic abilities are regarded as the main reasons for poor prognosis in malignant tumors. In the present study, lncRNA overexpression promoted the invasiveness and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo by sponging miRNAs. Clinically, lncRNA expression negatively correlates with the levels of miRNAs in human cancer tissues [ 3 , 30 , 33 ]. Consequently, the current study confirmed that some miRNAs were sponged by lncRNA, which in turn, promote the invasiveness and metastasis of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Recent bioinformatics analyses and luciferase reporter assays identified lncRNA MALAT1 as a potential ceRNA that sponges miR-216a-5p [ 38 ], miR-126-5p [ 39 ], and miR-328 [ 40 ] in NSCLC. Our findings suggested that MALAT1 might promote the invasiveness and metastasis of tumor cells by regulating miR-1914-3p, which agrees with previous findings [ 38 â€“ 40 ]. In bone marrow cells, the hematopoietic deficiency of MALAT1 promotes atherosclerosis and plaque inflammation. MALAT1 upregulation also contributes to endothelial cell function and vessel growth. In human multiple myeloma, MALAT1 inhibits gene expression of proteasome subunits and triggers anti-multiple myeloma activity via LNA gapmeR antisense oligonucleotides. However, these findings were challenged by the study of Kim et al., which showed that MALAT1 is a metastasis-suppressing lncRNA that interacts with TEAD rather than a metastasis promoter in breast cancer, calling for the reconsideration of the roles of this highly abundant and conserved lncRNA. Thus, MALAT1 exerts distinct effects on different tumors. The level of this specific lncRNA might be valuable for NSCLC prognosis, and thus, further investigations of the relationship between MALAT1 and miR-1914-3p should be carried out.
