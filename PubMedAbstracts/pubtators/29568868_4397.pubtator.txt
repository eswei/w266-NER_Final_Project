29568868_4397|a| The polo-like kinases (Plks), a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, are essential in cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage signaling ( 15 ). Plk1 is essential for cell cycle regulation, and has been characterized with an oncogenic role in several types of cancer ( 16 ). However, the exact role of Plk2 in human cancer remains a topic of debate. A predominate suppression of the expression of Plk2 has been observed in B-cell lymphoma and ovarian cancer ( 17 , 18 ). Plk2 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer ( 19 ). Furthermore, a lower expression of Plk2 was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer treated by irradiation ( 20 ). These observations suggested that Plk2 may serve as a tumor suppressor. Plk2 has been reported to be essential for promoting survival and inhibiting apoptosis in other cancer cells, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck carcinoma, and osteosarcoma ( 21 â€“ 23 ). Previously, Ou et al reported that the protein levels of Plk2 were significantly elevated in tumor tissues, and were associated with adverse prognosis in CRC ( 24 ). These data suggested that the mechanism of Plk2 in carcinogenesis and cancer progression is more complex than previously expected. Whether Plk2 is involved in the chemoresistance of CRC remains to be fully elucidated.
