29876326_2284|a| Interest in endostatin, an anti-tumor molecule in cancers, has increased over the last two decades. Endostatin is described as a 22 kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, which is a vascular and epithelial basement membrane protein( 2 , 3 ).Previous studies have demonstrated various functions of this protein. For example, endostatin can cause apoptosis of the endothelial cells and serves as a suppressor of endothelial cell migration and tumor growth ( 4 â€“ 6 ). Indeed, endostatin interferes with tumor progression by preventing the activity of tumor growth-stimulating factors ( 7 , 8 ). Furthermore, a few studies have reported that endostatin inhibits tumor metastasis by limiting blood supply, and therefore is considered a potential anti-tumor marker in malignant tumor treatment ( 9 , 10 ). To date, many studies have investigated endostatin levels in different types of cancers such as soft tissue sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma ( 11 - 13 ). In addition, the association of endostatin level with prognosis and aggressiveness of tumors has been confirmed. It has already been established that patients with poor prognosis cancers have higher serum levels of endostatin ( 14 - 16 ). Investigations into the prognostic significance of circulating endostatin levels have demonstrated the association of higher serum levels of endostatin with progressive and poorly differentiated colorectal and bladder cancers ( 17 , 18 ). It is therefore reasonable to assume that serum endostatin levels can be used as a biomarker for diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of cancers. This study was conducted to investigate the potential role of serum endostatin levels in head and neck SCC as well as the correlation between serum endostatin levels and various clinical and pathological features.
