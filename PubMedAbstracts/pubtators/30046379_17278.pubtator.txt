30046379_17278|a| The role of hyperglycemia in diabetes vasculopathy has been well-acknowledged. Although the vascular endothelium has adaptive mechanisms to counteract hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, superfluous ROS levels induce endothelial dysfunction. In endothelial cells, increased superoxide generation represents the hallmark of hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress [ 23 ]. Accordingly, HUVECs exposed to HG and aorta of STZ diabetic rats showed markedly elevated levels of ROS. These findings are explained by the increased activity of NADPH oxidase which represents a major source of superoxide production under hyperglycemic conditions [ 17 , 24 ]. Here, HUVECs showed increased NOX-4 expression following exposure to HG levels. NOX-4 is the prominent and major subunit of NADPH oxidase that provokes the generation of superoxide anions in the endothelium [ 25 , 26 ]. Therefore, NOX-4 can induce oxidative damage [ 27 ] and endothelial injury [ 28 ] in response to cellular stress. Previous studies have also demonstrated increased NADPH oxidase in diabetic animals [ 9 , 26 ] and human patients [ 29 ]. In addition, the increased levels of ROS could be attributed to hyperglycemia-induced eNOS uncoupling and mitochondrial electron transport chain as previously demonstrated [ 30 â€“ 32 ]. Interestingly, a functional NOX-4 has been reported to be present in the mitochondria [ 33 ]. In a preparation of pure mitochondria, knockdown of NOX-4 by siRNA blocked mitochondrial superoxide generation induced by glucose [ 33 ]. Moreover, experimental evidence showed that genetic knockdown or inhibition of NOX-4 reduces ROS production in the vascular endothelium [ 27 , 34 ]. Along with the upregulated NOX-4, HG-induced HUVECs showed increased expression of NOX-2, a NADPH oxidase subunit known to be expressed in a significant amount in HUVECs as well as in rat aortic endothelium [ 26 ].
