30072957_2424|a| Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), also known as betatrophin, lipasin, TD26 and refeeding-induced fat and liver (RIFL), is a secreted protein of 198 amino acids primarily expressed in liver and adipose tissues ( 3 ). It is a newly identified endocrine regulator associated with insulin resistance, lipid and glucose metabolism, all of which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes ( 4 ). Animal studies showed that ANGPTL8 was positively related to triglycerides (TG) levels, TG levels were significantly lower in mice lacking ANGPTL8 than in control mice ( 5 ), whereas an overexpression of ANGPTL8 led to an increase in TG levels ( 6 ). A previous cohort study with the largest sample size has proved that circulating levels of ANGPTL8 were significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in control subjects with normal glucose tolerance ( 7 ), in addition, other studies and meta-analysis have also shown that ANGPTL8 was increased in people with type 2 diabetes ( 8 â€“ 15 ). Furthermore, some studies have reported a positive relationship between blood glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and ANGPTL8 in type 2 diabetic patients ( 10 , 11 ). Consequently, these findings above motivated us to speculate that increased circulating levels of ANGPTL8 might be positively related to urine albumin-to- creatinine ratio (ACR) and serve as a novel biomarker for diabetic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes.
