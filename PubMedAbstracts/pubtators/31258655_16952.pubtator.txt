31258655_16952|a| Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs serve as tumor suppressors in various types of cancer ( 27 â€“ 30 ). A previous study revealed that miR-141 suppressed TC cell growth and metastasis by suppressing insulin receptor substrate 2, indicating that miR-141 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with TC ( 31 ). Furthermore, miR-497 is also considered to be a TC tumor suppressor that acts by repressing brain derived neurotrophic factor ( 32 ). A previous study also indicated that miR-7 may function as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting serine/threonine protein kinase 1, potentially serving as a novel therapeutic target for TC ( 30 ). Therefore, miRNAs have been demonstrated to be associated with tumor development and progression, highlighting their potential use as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PTC. However, the prognostic relevance and functions of miR-30a in PTC remain largely unclear. The current study assessed the expression of miR-30a and their role in PTC cells. The results indicated that miR-30a was downregulated in PTC cell lines compared with normal cell lines. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of miR-30a inhibited PTC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
