30131852_6439|a| The DLX4 gene has two distinct splice variants, BP1 and DLX7, mapped to the same region on chromosome 17q21-22, that vary in their 5â€² regions. BP1 is known to act as a putative repressor of human b-globulin, but splice variant DXL7 does not have any known repressor activity [ 25 , 26 ]. They are both expressed in the myeloid lineage but distinct roles in leukemia have not been detailed [ 25 ]. It has been demonstrated that DLX4 is significantly expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma, with higher levels correlating with Ki-67 positive cells [ 27 ]. Earlier reports showed that over expression and/or gene amplification of the DLX4 gene may be associated with tumorigenesis in estrogen negative breast cancer [ 28 , 29 ]. Interestingly, Man et al. [ 30 ] demonstrated that protein expression of DLX4 (referred to as BP-1), measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC), is significantly higher, both in intensity and percentage of cells, in IBC cases from the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Registry (IBCR) than in non-IBC cases. That study, showed that BP-1 protein levels were barely detectable in normal human breast tissues, while 21% of hyperplastic tissues, and 81% of invasive breast tissues showed high protein expression. The authors suggest that BP-1 may represent a signature marker for IBC and tumor aggression. However, here is no racial delineation provided for the subjects related to these compelling results [ 30 ]. In the present study, we aim to characterize DLX4 expression in IBC tissues from AA women. We used IHC to analyze DLX4 expression in both IBC tissues and in normal breast tissues from reduction mammoplasty, from AA women, while also looking at other clinic-pathological factors including Her2/Neu, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status.
