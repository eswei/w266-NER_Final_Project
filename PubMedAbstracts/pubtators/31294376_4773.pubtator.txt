31294376_4773|a| Serotonin, or 5-HT, has been evaluated in IBD and in animal models of colitis. It was shown that TPH1-deficient mice, which have reduced gut 5-HT content, exhibit reduced susceptibility to experimental colitis marked by lower inflammatory cytokine production ( 14 ). Moreover, pharmacological blocking of peripheral 5-HT synthesis reduced the severity of both chemical and infection-induced intestinal inflammation ( 15 ). In IBD patients, studies have reported increased 5-HT expressing EC cell numbers and reduced 5-HTT expression, the latter particularly observed in association with inflammation in UC patients ( 16â€“18 ). Furthermore, a significant association between 5-HTTLPR and microscopic colitis, a type of colitis which had previously been associated with consumption of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, has been reported ( 6 , 19 ). Patients with microscopic colitis and UC were found to have significantly higher serum 5-HT levels ( 19 ). An elevated level of 5-HT was also observed in a patient with collagenous colitis ( 20 ). Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence for an important role of 5-HT in gut inflammation. Despite the importance of its cognate receptors in 5-HT signaling, only scattered observations about 5-HTRs in IBD have been previously reported by a handful of studies ( 21 , 22 ).
