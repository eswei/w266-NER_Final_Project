30679988_3564|a| MicroRNAs (miRs) are small (20â€“25 nucleotides), noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of certain target genes in various physiological and pathological processes ( 7 ). They serve key roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressors and thus regulate tumor progression and metastasis ( 8 , 9 ). Several critical miRs have been identified in RB progression. Hsa-miR-373 may be involved in RB invasion and metastasis, while hsa-miR-125b and hsa-let-7b may function as tumor suppressors by co-regulating cell division protein kinase 6, cell division cycle 25A and lin-28 homolog A ( 10 , 11 ). Furthermore. hsa-miR-181a may serve a key role in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B-regulated cell cycle pathway ( 10 ). Certain miRs, including hsa-miR-25, hsa-miR-18a and hsa-miR-20a may affect the progression of RB by coregulating BCL2-like 1 ( 10 ). Furthermore, miR-497 functions as a tumor suppressor in RB carcinogenesis and progression ( 12 ). He et al ( 13 ), demonstrated the suppressive effect of miR-143 in RB by targeting CDK6. In addition, miR-31 and miR-200a expression was revealed to be significantly reduced in human RBs and was determined to mediate the regulation of RB proliferation ( 4 ). miR-125b is also significantly upregulated in RB, promoting tumor growth and suppressing apoptosis ( 11 ). Castro-Magdonel et al ( 14 ), has recently revealed a miR landscape that exhibits a core-cluster of 30 miRs in RB. miR-3613 was also identified as being a potential and critical downregulatory marker in RB ( 14 ). However, the regulatory mechanisms involving miR in RB are yet to be fully elucidated.
