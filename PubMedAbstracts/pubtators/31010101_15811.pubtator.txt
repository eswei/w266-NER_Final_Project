31010101_15811|a| Glutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell metabolism [ 30 ]. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding glutamine metabolism in CRC, such as glutamine addiction, increased glutaminolysis, and autophagy activation for cancer cell survival and proliferation [ 31 , 32 , 33 ]. We speculated that the consumption of glutamine by CRC cells varies in every patient with different mutations, which may produce disparate levels of serum glutamine [ 33 , 34 , 35 ]. Serum glutamine level is maintained in circulation at a relatively constant level of 0.6â€“0.9 mmol/L in the normal population [ 17 ]. The decreased concentration of serum glutamine in cancer patients may be associated with higher demand by proliferating cancer cells [ 21 ]. Regardless of the diversified postulated mechanisms, our study showed that low pretreatment serum glutamine level was an independent poor prognostic factor in CRC patients. In recent decades, several trials have shown that glutamine supplementation in CRC patients may reduce chemotherapy-related side effects, such as mucositis, intestinal toxicity, and neuropathy [ 36 , 37 , 38 ]. Two large prospective studies also indicated that dietary glutamine or glutamic acid intake may reduce CRC incidence in non-overweight individuals, as well as cancer mortality [ 39 , 40 ]. Targeting of glutamine metabolism has recently emerged as a cancer treatment [ 20 ]. Whether glutamine supplementation to maintain adequate serum glutamine level and block glutamine intake by cancer cells can improve the outcome of CRC patients requires further studies.
