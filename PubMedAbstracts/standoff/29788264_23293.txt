 We next wished to address whether activation of MPK-1 signaling would show the reverse effect and exacerbate the developmental arrest upon UV-induced DNA damage. We, therefore, tested a mutant for the MPK-1 phosphatase lip-1 ( 22 ). A lip-1 mutation indeed enhanced the arrest of csb-1-mutated worms (Figure 3A). In addition, we assessed a let-60(ga89) mutant, that carry a constitutive active gain-of-function mutation in the retrovirus-associated DNA sequence (RAS) homolog in C. elegans let-60 ( 23 ). The double mutant let-60;csb-1 show a stronger arrest than the csb-1 mutant alone (Figure 3B). Both let-60(ga89) and lip-1(gt448) enhance MPK-1/ERK signaling pathway activation, and lead to a stronger arrest of csb-1 mutants after UV treatment. Thus, modulation of MPK-1/ERK signaling pathway affects the developmental arrest upon UV treatment of TC-NER mutants: activation of the pathway exacerbates the arrest, while inhibition promotes developmental growth amid DNA damage.
