 Urea at concentrations relevant to CKD has been reported to directly increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in adipocytes [ 24 ], pancreatic β–cells [ 25 ], and aortic endothelial cells [ 26 ]. D’Apolito et al. demonstrated that urea induced ROS production in adipocytes, leading to insulin resistance [ 24 ]. Koppe et al. also reported that urea increased oxidative stress and protein O-linked N-glucosamine acylation in islets, resulting in insulin secretory defects [ 25 ]. Recently, in a large cohort study, higher BUN levels were associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus; the HR (95% CI) for poor outcomes in patients with a BUN > 25 mg/dL was 1.23 (1.21–1.25) compared with a BUN ≤25 mg/dL [ 27 ]. These findings could support the above experimental findings by D’Apolito et al. [ 24 ] and Koppe et al. [ 25 ]. Alternatively, oxidative stress is progressively enhanced and correlates with the degree of kidney dysfunction in patients with CKD [ 28 , 29 ]. Previous reports suggested that oxidative stress might be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of kidney disease. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine is considered a useful marker for predicting the development of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients [ 30 ]. It was also suggested that malondialdehyde might play an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis [ 31 ] and that advanced oxidation protein products were associated with the pathogenesis and progression of IgA nephropathy [ 32 ]. However, it remains unknown whether urea-induced oxidative stress directly contributes to kidney disease progression.
