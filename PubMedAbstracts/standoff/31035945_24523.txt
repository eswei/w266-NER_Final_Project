 In this work plasma concentrations of SCC-Ag were significantly higher in the cervical cancer group compared to the healthy controls. Our data is in agreement with the results of other researchers regarding the diagnostic usefulness of antigen SCC in this malignancy [ 65 , 66 ]. Moreover, its prognostic significance, both for the recurrence-free and overall survival, has been confirmed by other researchers in the early stages of cervical cancer [ 67 , 68 ]. Considering squamous cell cervical cancer group, the highest SE and SP was obtained for both SCC-Ag and CA 125 simultaneously and M-CSF, respectively. Suzuki et al. demonstrated that preoperative serum measurement of M-CSF combined with SCC-Ag can be selective diagnostic marker for squamous cell carcinoma arising in mature cystic teratoma of the ovary [ 69 ]. However, in our study, the greatest AUC for this type of cancer was obtained for VEGF, which is in agreement with study performed by Lebrecht et al. [ 70 ]. Analysis showed that VEGF in conjunction with SCC-Ag and CA 125 demonstrated the highest SE when assessed together. Nevertheless, some studies state that the most useful serum marker for squamous cell cervical cancer diagnosis is still SCC-Ag [ 71 , 72 ]. However, our research clearly indicated that M-CSF demonstrated higher diagnostic power in squamous cell carcinoma group compared to the commonly used tumor markers- SCC-Ag and CA 125.
