 Recent studies have shown that lincRNA-p21 regulates signaling transduction in tumor growth. Down-regulated lincRNA-p21 promotes gastric cancer development through activation of YAP independent of Hippo [ 21 ]. In hypoxic tumor cells, lincRNA-p21 knockdown represses the autophagy via regulating HIF-1/Akt/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway [ 22 ]. LincRNA-p21 negatively regulates miR-9/E-cadherin cascade to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 23 ]. Furthermore, lincRNA-p21 participates in dysregulated glucose metabolism in tumor cells. It binds with VHL and dissociates the HIF-1α from VHL–HIF-1α complex, leading to activation of glycolysis [ 24 ]. Here, we reported that glutamine catabolism was suppressed by lincRNA-p21. Intracellular glutamate and α-KG level were decreased in lincRNA-p21 overexpressed BC cells, while they were increased in lincRNA-p21 silenced cells. GLS was down-regulated and up-regulated in lincRNA-p21 overexpressed and silenced BC cells, respectively. These results suggest that lincRNA-p21 regulates glutamine catabolism through GLS. Importantly, the BC tissues which had lowly expressed lincRNA-p21 also showed up-regulated GLS, highlighting the clinical relevance of the lincRNA-p21 regulation of GLS in BC patients. Since GLS-dependent glutamine catabolism was positively regulated by Myc oncogene through its suppression of miR-23a and miR-23b [ 13 ], the potential link between lincRNA-p21 and c-Myc/miR-23a/b should be further explored.
