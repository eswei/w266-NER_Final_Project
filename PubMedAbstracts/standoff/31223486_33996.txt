 Ang II regulates ROS through upregulation of Nox [ 41 ]. Angiotensin II-induced ROS can cause vasoconstriction, inflammation, and vascular remodeling through activation of multiple pathways. In our study, Ang II increased the aortic expression of Nox1 and Nox2 mRNA but did not affect the expression of Nox4. The HDAC8-selective inhibitor did not decrease Nox1 and Nox2 expression. This result implies that HDACs other than HDAC8 modulate Nox expression. Cardiac Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 mRNA levels significantly increased in SHR hypertensive rats compared to that in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) control rats [ 55 ]. Gallic acid, which inhibits HDAC5, HDAC7, HDAC8, and HDAC9, ameliorated Nox2 mRNA and protein levels in SHR [ 56 ]. Manea et al. reported that SAHA decreased the aortic expression of Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 in diabetic mice by regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 [ 57 ]. In contrast, increased expression of HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC5 is associated with induction of Nox2 and Nox4 in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which was decreased by the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid [ 58 ]. The results of the above study show that the expression of Nox varies depending on the type of disease; for example, arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, or diabetes. The pan-HDAC inhibitor was more effective in reducing the expression of Nox than an HDAC isoform-specific inhibitor.
