 Conclusion and perspectives Rab27A and Rab27B act as oncogenes in cancer. Biological and clinicopathological findings have revealed that elevated Rab27A/B expression levels affect cancer progression and survival in patients. In addition to cancer biomarkers, such as microRNAs and E-cadherin [ 66 – 70 ], Rab27A and Rab27B are also potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. The development of Rab27A/B-specific inhibitors, which are currently not available, is needed to investigate the possible use of Rab27A/B-targeting agents to improve cancer therapy. The mechanisms that lead to elevated expression of Rab27A/B in cancer are still unclear. To date, only one report has demonstrated Rab27A gene amplification in melanoma [ 34 ]. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms that lead to Rab27A/B overexpression in order to develop novel methods for cancer prevention. Rab27A and Rab27B promote cancer progression by increasing exosome secretion, which enhances the formation of a tumor-supporting microenvironment. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms through which Rab27A and Rab27B regulate exosome secretion will facilitate the identification of possible therapeutic interventions to improve cancer treatment.
