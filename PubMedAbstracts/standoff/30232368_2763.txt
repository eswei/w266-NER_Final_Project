 Several genes have already been certified as causative genes in patients with autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism with pyramidal tract signs, including ATPase 13A2 (ATP13A2), phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6) and F-box protein 7 (FBXO7). The ATP13A2 (PARK9) gene is responsible for Kufor–Rakeb syndrome (KRS), a rare hereditary form of recessive, juvenile-onset, atypical parkinsonism with pyramidal tract signs and cognitive dysfunction ⁶ . The ATP13A2 gene encodes a lysosomal P-type ATPase, its dysfunction may lead to lysosomal impairment, α-synuclein accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction those closely associated with PD ⁷ . Many studies had reported ATP13A2 variants that might leads to higher PD risk ⁸ – ¹⁰ . The PLA2G6 (PARK14) gene encodes a group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta enzyme, which has been proved as a pathogenic factor for neurodegenerative disorders with increased basal ganglia iron accumulation, such as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) ¹¹ . Previous studies suggested that this gene was also associated with juvenile-onset dystonia parkinsonism and classic idiopathic PD ¹² – ¹⁵ . The FBOX7 (PARK15) gene encodes an E3 ligase, F-box only protein 7, which is involved in ubiquitin proteasome system ¹⁶ and mitochondrial maintenance ¹⁷ . Pathogenic variants in FBXO7 gene are likely to cause the EOPD in a similar way to the Parkin and PINK1 genes ¹⁷ .
