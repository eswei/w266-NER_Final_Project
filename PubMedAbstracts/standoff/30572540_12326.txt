 3.3 TCPTC-specific differentially expressed mRNAs Using |log2FC| > 1.0 and P < .05 as the cut-off criteria, we extracted 4138 DEGs (2312 downregulated and 1826 upregulated genes) between the TCPTC and normal tissues, and 3103 DEGs (1723 downregulated and 1380 upregulated genes) between the cPTC and normal tissues. The DEGs between the TCPTC and normal tissues were defined as TCPTC-related DEGs. Among the TCPTC-related DEGs, TMPRSS6, TM7SF4, SYT12, MUC21, and TMPRSS4 were the most significantly upregulated DEGs, and PKHD1L1, TFF3, LRP1B, CUX2, and ZMAT4 were the most significantly downregulated DEGs. Furthermore, 455 DEGs were identified between TCPTC and cPTC with the same threshold, of which 134 genes were downregulated and 321 genes were upregulated. DEGs between TCPTC and cPTC that were also found among the PTC-related DEGs (genes dysregulated in both TCPTC and cPTC tissues compared with normal tissues) were defined as TCPTC-specific DEGs. According to this protocol, 301 TCPTC-specific DEGs, including 96 downregulated and 205 upregulated genes, were identified between the TCPTC and cPTC tissues (Figs. 3 and 4). The average expression value in the PTC tissues (including TCPTC and cPTC tissues), fold change and P value details of the dysregulated genes are shown in Supplementary Table S2. COL11A1, MMP13, VTCN1, COL10A1, and SLC18A3 were the most significantly upregulated DEGs in the TCPTC tissues, while CA4, EDN3, TPO, PKHD1L1 and FOXJ1 were the most significantly downregulated DEGs in the TCPTC tissues compared with the cPTC tissues. Interestingly, the expression levels of nearly all putative oncogenes (genes upregulated in both TCPTC and cPTC compared with normal tissues, except for 7 genes) were much higher in the TCPTC tissues than those in the cPTC tissues. The expression levels of nearly all putative tumor suppressors (genes downregulated both in TCPTC and cPTC compared with normal tissues, except for 1 gene) were much lower in the TCPTC tissues than those in the cPTC tissues. Figure 3 Venn diagram of 301 TCPTC-specific DEGs. A total of 301 TCPTC-specific DEGs were identified from the 3 comparison groups (TCPTC versus NT, cPTC versus NT, and TCPTC versus cPTC). DEGs = differentially expressed genes, NT = normal tissues, cPTC = classical/conventional variant Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, TCPTC = tall cell variant papillary thyroid carcinoma. Figure 4 Heatmap of the 301 TCPTC-specific DEGs. Hierarchical analysis of the 301 TCPTC-specific DEGs based on their expression values in the TCPTC and cPTC tissues. All values are presented as log10 (RSEM), DEGs = differentially expressed genes, cPTC = classical/conventional variant Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, RSEM = RNAseq by expectation-maximization, TCPTC = tall cell variant papillary thyroid carcinoma.
