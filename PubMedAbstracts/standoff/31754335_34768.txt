 In recent years, miR-199a-3p has been found to play multiple roles in different diseases by targeting many genes involved in different biological processes 36 - 39 . For instance, the downregulation of miR-199a contributes to paclitaxel (PTX) resistance through targeting the oncogene Yamaguchi sarcoma viral homolog 1 (YES1) in prostate cancer 36 . MiR-199a/b-3p inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation via downregulating the PAK4 (p21 activated kinase 4)/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1) signaling pathway 37 . MiR-199a-3p increases the cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells by downregulating ITGB8 (Integrin subunit Beta 8) expression 38 . MiR-199a is downregulated in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and is associated with increased SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) level 39 . These findings clearly suggest that miR-199a-3p plays important roles in different biological processes through regulating the expression of multiple genes. However, none of these studies investigated the underlying mechanism of miR-199a-3p aberrant expression. To demonstrate the mechanism of miR-199a-3p downregulation in ALI lung tissues, we excluded the possibility of DNA methylation by treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor AZA. Finally, we identified a transcriptional mechanism mediated by CHFTC.
