 Besides, this study testified that miR-138-5p could directly target FOXK1. It is reported that FOXK1 level was higher in liver cancer cells than in normal human hepatic cell line, FOXK1 silencing was found to repress cell viability (Cui et al. 2018 ). Moreover, FOXK1 level was elevated in glioma tissue samples and cell lines, and FOXK1 was identified to enhance cell growth in glioma (Ji and Jiang 2018 ). Interestingly, we discovered that FOXK1 level was increased in PC tissues, suggesting that FOXK1 might be employed by PC cell to stimulate cell growth. Importantly, positive correlation between MCM3AP-AS1 and FOXK1 was found, whereas negative correlation between miR-138-5p and FOXK1 was also confirmed. MCM3AP-AS1 silencing led to decreased FOXK1 level, whereas FOXK1 level was reversed in BxPC-3 cells expressing MCM3AP-AS1-silencing and miR-138-5p inhibitor. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that MCM3AP-AS1 stimulated growth and invasion in PC cells by regulating FOXK1 expression. Notably, previous studies have discovered that lncRNAs participated in the progression of tumors by targeting miRNAs and regulating FOXK1 expression. For instance, Dong et al. discovered LINC02163 could augment growth in gastric cancer cells by miR-593-3p/FOXK1 axis (Dong et al. 2018 ). Lu et al. proved LINC01503 facilitated cell proliferation and invasion in colorectal cancer via miR-4492/FOXK1 axis (Lu et al. 2018 ). Consistent with the previous studies, our study revealed that MCM3AP-AS1 promoted PC cell growth and invasion by miR-138-5p/FOXK1 in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the significant role of MCM3AP-AS1/miR-138-5p/FOXK1 axis in PC.
