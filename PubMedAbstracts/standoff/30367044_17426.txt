 Identification of mutations related to NASH-HCC in mice Several of the mutated genes we identified in murine NASH-HCCs have been reported as drivers in other human cancers, such as Mtor ¹³ , Sdk1 ¹⁴ , Braf ¹⁵ , Pik3cb ¹⁶ , Ctnnd1 ¹⁷ , Ctnna3 ¹⁸ , Akt3 ¹⁹ , and Nos2 ²⁰ . We identified 82 genes to be recurrently mutated in two or more NASH-HCCs (Fig. 5c; Supplementary Data 2); these included two genes mutated in 4/5 NASH-HCCs (Ryr1 and Sdk1); 8 genes mutated in 3/5 NASH-HCCs (Epha8, Pcdh15, Fat2, Cep152, Ttn, Rxfp1, Aox3l1 and Pkd1l3) and 71 genes mutated in 2/5 NASH-HCCs (notably Mtor, Ryr2, Cacna1h, Col7a1, Fcgbp, Adam29, Gpr98 and Pclo). Only 2 of the 82 genes (Ttn and Obscn) were also mutated in one HF-associated steatosis-HCC each, and only one gene (Kif3c) was recurrently mutated in steatosis-HCCs. These results suggested that mutations of these known or potential cancer driver genes contribute to the development of cholesterol-associated NASH-HCC. The recurrent mutations suggest that Mtor and Sdk1 may also function as cancer drivers in NASH-HCC, while other recurrently mutated genes could represent novel candidates associated with NASH-HCC.
