 miR-143-5p and AMPK are upregulated while eEF2 is downregulated and cartilage differentiation is inhibited in degenerative IVD tissues The mRNA and protein levels of cartilage differentiation-related and AMPK signaling pathway-related genes in normal IVD and degenerative IVD were detected using RT-qPCR (Fig. 4a) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4b, c). When compared to the normal IVD, degenerative IVD showed significantly decreased mRNA and protein levels of mTOR, Bcl-2, cyclinD and eEF2, and p-mTOR/t-mTOR protein level ratio, while obviously increased mRNA and protein levels of Bax and AMPK, p-AMPK/t-AMPK protein level ratio, and miR-143-5p expression.

When compared to the normal IVD, degenerative IVD showed significantly decreased levels of COL2, ACAN, and DCN proteins (p < 0.05). Therefore, these results demonstrated that miR-143-5p highly expressed and AMPK signaling pathway activation was induced in degenerative IVD, while eEF2 lowly expressed and cartilage differentiation was inhibited.
