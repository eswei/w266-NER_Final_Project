 Up to now, numerous studies show that lncRNA is frequently dysregulated in human cancers and can be used as an effective biomarker [ 18 ]. For instance, high lncRNA SNHG1 expression was positively correlated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer patients [ 19 ]. LncRNA MALAT-1 expression in serum was identified as a good distinction between hepatocellular carcinoma patients and healthy controls [ 20 ]. LncRNA CASC11 was shown to be markedly increased in osteosarcoma and predicted dismal survival [ 21 ]. Likewise, some lncRNAs related to the diagnosis or prognosis of GC have been reported, such as FLJ22763 [ 22 ], GMAN [ 23 ], ZEB1-AS1 [ 24 ] and UCA1 [ 25 ]. Herein, we found that GC patients with low TUBA4B expression displayed shorter survival time than patients with high TUBA4B expression, and the AUC value based on plasma TUBA4B expression was 0.8075 (95% CI 0.7103 to 0.9047), implying that TUBA4B is an efficacious diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for GC patients. Further large sample studies are needed to confirm our findings, and it would be worthwhile to clarify the crosstalk between TUBA4B and the above reported GC-associated lncRNAs, and whether TUBA4B can be detected in urine and exosomes.
