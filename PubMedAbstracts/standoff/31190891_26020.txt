 Previous reports have demonstrated that lncRNAs can exert biological effects through a number of mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Accumulating evidence indicates that lncRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and sponging miRNAs. For example, lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 7 (PCAT7) accelerates tumorigenesis by inhibiting miR-134-5p in NSCLC and is associated with poor prognosis. 16 LncRNA LINC00339 promotes the carcinogenesis of NSCLC by targeting FOXM1 and thus, sponging miR-145. 17 Zeng et al reported that DLX6-AS1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of renal cell carcinoma by targeting the miR-26a/PTEN axis. 9 Li et al reported that DLX6-AS1 accelerates glioma tumorigenesis by sponging endogenous miR-197-5p to decrease its targeting of E2F1. 12 In our study, we confirmed that miR-27b-3p was a target of DLX6-AS1. Numerous studies have demonstrated that miR-27b-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in many types of cancers. 18 â€“ 20 Sun et al reported that miR-27b-3p is downregulated in lung cancer tissues and this promotes apoptosis and suppresses cancer cell viability and survival via the downregulation of Fzd7. 21 In our study, miR-27b-3p was also shown to be downregulated in NSCLC tissues and its expression was negatively correlated with DLX6-AS1 expression. Furthermore, miR-27b-3p mimics reversed the antitumor effects of DLX6-AS1 on NSCLC. GSPT1 has been reported as an oncogene in gastric cancer, 22 colorectal cancer, 23 and breast cancer. 24 GSPT1 is a GTPase that associates with eukaryotic Release Factor 1 (eRF1) in a complex mediates that translation termination. 24 GSPT1 has been shown to play several roles in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, cytoskeleton organization and apoptosis. Sajitha et al reported that nicotine mediated invasion and migration of NSCLC cells by modulating STMN3 and GSPT1. 25 In the present study, GSPT1 was confirmed as the target mRNA of DLX6-AS1 and its expression was negatively correlated with miR-27b-3p expression in NSCLC samples. GSPT1 expression was significantly decreased in NSCLC cells after siDLX6-AS1 transfection. These results demonstrated that DLX6-AS1 exerted its tumorigenesis role by targeting miR-27b-3p/GSPT1.
