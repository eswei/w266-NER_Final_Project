 In conclusion, plasma lipocalin-2 levels were significantly higher in CSF biomarker defined preclinical AD subjects compared with biomarker negative control subjects. Furthermore, plasma lipocalin-2 levels were associated with CSF Aβ₄₂ levels and executive function. Although the exact pathophysiological role of lipocalin-2 in AD remains controversial and verification of these results in additional prospective studies are needed, these results support circulating lipocalin-2 as a marker of early Aβ pathology.Research in Context 1. Systematic review: Review of 15+ years of literature (e.g., PubMed) on the relation between lipocalin-2 (also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, 24p3, or siderocalin) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed results from human studies to be inconclusive, which may be from lack of validation of the clinical diagnosis with AD biomarkers. In addition, there were no studies that measured plasma lipocalin-2 in biomarker-confirmed preclinical AD. 2. Interpretation: The results from this cross-sectional study support lipocalin-2 playing a role early in AD pathogenesis and plasma lipocalin-2 as a potential early blood biomarker of amyloid-beta pathology. 3. Future directions: Additional research is needed to validate these findings in larger more diverse cohorts and in longitudinal studies. The use of cerebrospinal fluid lipocalin-2 as a potential AD biomarker and any differences with plasma lipocalin-2 should be clarified. Finally, the role of lipocalin-2 in iron metabolism and neuroinflammation in biomarker-confirmed AD should be explored.
