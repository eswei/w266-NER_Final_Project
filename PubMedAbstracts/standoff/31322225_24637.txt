 The roles of the other potential targets (AMOT, GREM1, CACNA2D3, IRF6, and LPL) with PCa progression were elusive. AMOT serves a role in PCa proliferation via the Hippo/YAP pathway ( 35 ). miR-205 regulated the proliferation and the invasion of breast cancer cells by suppressing the expression of AMOT ( 36 ). In addition, another study indicated that miR-497 could directly target the AMOT gene in human osteosarcoma cells to inhibit cell proliferation and invasion ( 37 ). GREM1 can serve as the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist during human cancer progression ( 38 ). miR-128-3p suppressed the proliferation and metastatic potential of glioma cells by targeting GREM1 ( 39 ). CACNA2D3 may serve as a pivotal gene in ERG-positive prostate cancer ( 40 ). The developmental transcription factor IRF6 may be associated with cell proliferation, cancer stem cell properties and chemotherapeutic sensitivity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( 41 ). The LPL gene is commonly methylated in PCa and may be involved in tumor progression ( 42 ). However, the role between these potential gene targets and miR-505 should be further revealed.
