 In our previous study, we detected the expression of S100A proteins in the paired tumor samples (pre- and post- chemotherapy) obtained from 68 squamous cervical cancer patients who were treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy, and revealed that S100A9 protein expression in tumor cells correlated with tumor response to chemotherapy. 13 Similar to our research, Zhu et al 14 found that cervical squamous carcinoma patients, who received the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, with negative staining of S100A9 showed significantly lower 5-year overall survival rate than those with positive staining. The above results suggested that S100A9 may be associated with the chemosensitivity of squamous cervical cancer. However, we also found the expression intensity of S100A9 was statistically higher in post-chemotherapy cervical cancer tissues in comparison with that in pre-chemotherapy. 13 In our further study, 15 four squamous cervical cancer cell lines were selected with diverse human papillomavirus expression, SiHa, C-33A, CaSki, and MS751, and found that the S100A9 mRNA and protein were moderately expressed in SiHa cells. In addition, S100A9 could promote squamous cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, whether S100A9 promotes or inhibits cisplatin sensitivity remains controversial.
