 Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous disease encompassing behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and the primary progressive aphasias (PPAs): the semantic variant (svPPA), the nonfluent variant (nfvPPA), and the logopenic variant (lvPPA). ¹ , ² Motor neuron disease (MND), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are considered as part of the FTD spectrum. ³ The underlying pathology, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is heterogeneous with tau (FTLD-tau), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP), or fused in sarcoma inclusions (FTLD-FUS). ⁴ Underlying pathology can only be predicted in genetic FTD: microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutations cause FTLD-tau, and progranulin (GRN) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutations cause FTLD-TDP. ⁵ The svPPA and FTD-MND are often associated with FTLD-TDP, and PSP with FTLD-tau, whereas underlying pathology can poorly be predicted in bvFTD. ⁶
