 CA-125 is a glycoprotein produced by the serous epithelium, and has been known as a tumor marker used for diagnosing ovarian cancer. Recently, the significance of CA-125 emerged in heart failure being associated with clinical status, hemodynamic abnormalities, and echocardiographic parameters. It has been broadly investigated in various types of heart failure such as valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [ 23 - 26 ]. Although the mechanism for the association between heart failure and elevated serum CA-125 level is obscure, CA-125 levels are closely related to serosal fluid accumulation and positively correlated with various inflammatory cytokines in patients with heart failure. It is hypothesized that mechanical stress, such as fluid overload, and inflammatory stimuli may initiate CA-125 synthesis in the mesothelial cells located on the surfaces of the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum [ 27 ]. The serum level of CA-125 was higher in patients with advanced NYHA class and also associated with invasive or non-invasive findings, such as the right atrial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure by cardiac catheterization or right ventricular systolic pressure by echocardiography. After medical therapy optimization in patients with chronic heart failure, CA-125 level decreased compared with the levels on the day of admission [ 12 , 13 ]. Additionally, CA-125 could be used as a prognostic factor in patients with acute and chronic heart failure [ 12 - 17 ]. CA-125 had a similar accuracy in predicting major adverse events or death alone compared with serum NT-proBNP, which is a traditional and potent prognostic biomarker of mortality and morbidity in patients with ADHF [ 28 ].
