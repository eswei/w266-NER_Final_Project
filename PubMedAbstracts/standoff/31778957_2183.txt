 Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a member of the galectin family of β-galactoside-binding proteins. ⁵ Previous studies have indicated that Gal-1 is highly expressed in many kinds of tumors and in the tumor stroma. 6 , 7 , 8 Since 1995, Gal-1 has been found to induce the apoptosis of T cells. Gal-1 triggers T cell apoptosis by redistributing and segregating the clustering of CD3 and CD45 and the clustering of CD7 and CD43 into membrane microdomains. ⁹ Gal-1 also acts as an antagonist in T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction. ¹⁰ Furthermore, a previous study on head and neck cancer revealed a strong inverse correlation between Gal-1 and CD3 expression. ¹¹ The first in vivo evidence of Gal-1-mediated immune regulation and tumor immune escape was demonstrated in a study on melanoma. ¹² Gal-1 knockdown in melanoma cells slowed tumor growth by decreasing T cells apoptosis. In lung cancer, cancer-derived Gal-1 activated lung cancer-associated fibroblasts and triggered the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2)/kynurenine axis, which impaired T cell differentiation and function. ¹³ In addition to tumors, high Gal-1 expression in the tumor stroma also plays a role in immunosuppression. Gal-1 is highly expressed in activated pancreatic stellate cells and induces T cell apoptosis in pancreatic cancers. ¹⁴ Stromal Gal-1 can maintain the immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these results show that Gal-1 acts as an immune suppressor by directly promoting T cell apoptosis or indirectly impairing T cell differentiation in tumor cells and their microenvironment. Therefore, Gal-1 could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.
