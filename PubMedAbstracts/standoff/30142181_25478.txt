 Folate deficiency resulting from MTHFR polymorphism could impair the DNA repair function for chromosome damage caused by environmental factor such as alcohol, smoking, HPV virus, while folate intake could also reduce the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancers[ 38 ]. Meanwhile, previous study have demonstrated that high folic acid consumption could reduce MTHFR protein and activity, creating a pseudo-MTHFR deficiency[ 39 ]. Combined with the important role of MTHFR in the folate metabolism process, the hypothesis of gene-environmental factor interaction in carcinogenesis has been purposed. For example, MTHFR 677 TT genotype was found to have high risk association with heavy drinking population (>396g ethanol/week) rather than light drinking population(<198g ethanol/week)[ 24 ]. The risk for multiple methylation was also significantly increased in heavy-drinking patients with TT genotype compared with CC and CT genotype(20940365). Similarly, concomitant use of alcohol, cigarette and possessing T allele of C677T were significantly higher in OSCC patients[ 21 ]. Besides, the investigators have found homozygotes (TT) of C677T with low levels of folate were significantly associated with decreased methylation of MGMT in Chinese glioma patients[ 40 ]. Low vitamin B2 and low methionine intake were significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal tumor in individuals with homozygotes (TT) of C677T [ 41 ]. However, some studies demonstrated no overall association in breast cancer patients[ 42 ]. Therefore, these findings, as well as significant interactions between MTHFR polymorphisms and environmental triggers, or nutrients warrant further investigation.
