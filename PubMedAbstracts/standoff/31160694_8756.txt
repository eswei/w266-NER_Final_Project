 Assessment of HMTs and HDMs gene expression Further, we aimed to find out whether the reduction in observed H3K4me levels was due to the aberrant expression of underlying histone modifiers. Henceforth, gene expression of 13 HMTs and 7 HDMs were analyzed in 50 ccRCC patients and adjacent normal tissues using real-time PCR. The data disclosed a differential transcriptomic profile of H3K4 modifiers. Among 13 HMTs, the three genes namely MLL4, SMYD3, and ASH2 were decresed in tumor tissue as compared to normal; however, this reduction was not statistically significant (p = 0.48, 0.187, 0.429 respectively; Fig. 4a–c). On the other hand, the expression of five genes namely, MLL3, MLL5, KMT2F, KMT2G and NSD3 was augmented in ccRCC. However, this increase was not to the level of significance (p = 0.096, 0.297, 0.554, 0.466, 0.155 respectively; Fig. 4d–h). Strikingly, four genes; MLL1 (p = 0.012), MLL2 (p = 0.024), SMYD2 (p = 0.016) and NSD2 (p = 0.004) was significantly increased in ccRCC in comparison to normal tissues (Fig. 4i–l). Surprisingly, the expression of SMYD1 gene was not detected in tumor tissues or adjacent normal renal parenchyma.

(*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01). Out of seven HDMs specific for the H3K4 position, the mRNA levels of KDM5D and LSD1 genes were non-significantly reduced in ccRCC to that of normal tissue (p = 0.166, 0.468 respectively; Fig. 5a,b). Whilst, the expression of KDM5A (p = 0.001), KDM5B (p = 0.047), LSD2 (p = 0.002), FBXL10 (p = 0.0001) and KDM5C genes was augmented in ccRCC and data were statistically significant except KDM5C (p = 0.062; Fig. 5c–g). The clustered heat map for all the 20 genes was created using MeV (Multiple Experiment Viewer; Fig. S2).

Interestingly, comparative data on HMTs and HDMs genes expression revealed that higher percentage of HDMs were significantly up-regulated with a cumulative expression of about 1.31 times higher as compared to HMTs, indicating overweight of HDMs in ccRCC (p = 0.032; Fig. 6a,b). These findings revealed that up-regulation of HDMs relative to HMTs is involved in the reduction of H3K4me patterns in ccRCC.
