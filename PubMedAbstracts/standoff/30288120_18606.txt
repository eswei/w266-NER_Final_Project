 A large number of studies indicate that miRNAs are involved in many important physiological processes. 25 , 26 miR-145-5p, a famous tumor suppressor, was frequently downregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 27 prostate cancer, 28 non-small cell lung cancer, 29 and colorectal cancer. 30 Some studies have shown that miR-145-5p inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth by directly binding to p70S6K1 3â€²-UTR. 18 Our data also confirmed their interaction with breast cancer cells by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. p70S6K1, a downstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, has been reported as a key regulator of cell growth, metabolism, survival, and drug resistance. 31 p70S6K1 was markedly over-expressed in many human cancers and was closely related to tumor malignancy and poor prognosis. 32 , 33 In this study, we found that miR-145-5p could significantly suppress the mRNA and protein expression of p70S6K1 and that the inhibition was retarded after ectopic expression of circZNF609, suggesting that circZNF609 increased oncogene p70S6K1 expression by sponging and sequestering miR-145-5p activity. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-145-5p or silencing of p70S6K1 could effectively reverse circZNF609-induced promotion of breast cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. Besides, we also found that circZNF609 was negatively and positively correlated with miR-145-5p and p70S6K1 in breast cancer tissues, respectively. These results showed the circZNF609/miR-145-5p/p70S6K1 axis is involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.
