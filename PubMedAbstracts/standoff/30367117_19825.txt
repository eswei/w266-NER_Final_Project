 The expression analyses reveal that AR coordinately induces targets involved in arachidonic acid metabolism in both ETS− and ETS+ PCa tumors. First, it is interesting that glycerol and arachidonic acid produced via ABDH2, promote prostate tumor growth [ 23 ]. Indeed, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens has shown a positive correlation of ABHD2 levels with high Gleason score, pathological nodal stage, low cancer-specific survival rates, and a resistance to docetaxel-based chemotherapy [ 23 ]. Second, ALOX15B (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type II) known to metabolize arachidonic acid to fatty acid hydroperoxides, is selectively regulated in PCa in an ETS-dependent fashion [ 29 ]. Finally, the expression of CYP2J2, which promotes tumor cell growth by converting arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids [ 24 ], is also up-regulated in ETS− tumors. Thus, given several other interesting metabolic targets are manifest in both ETS− and ETS+ PCa tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2A-B; Table S5), targeting arachidonate metabolism may represent a particularly attractive therapeutic vulnerability for these tumors.
