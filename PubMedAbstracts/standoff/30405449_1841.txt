 At present, research on the biological mechanism of mental addiction to addictive substances indicates that the dopamine (DA) system at the edge of the midbrain, which is also known as the “reward system,” plays a key role ( 3 ). This theory is consistent with the idea that “there is no addiction without rewards.” Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and can participate in reward response by inhibiting the DA system of the midbrain ( 4 ). In addition, in alcohol addiction, GABA (A) receptors are associated with alcohol tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal ( 5 ). As an important subunit of GABA-A, the GABA-Aα5 subunit is thought to be closely related to cognitive impairment. Lack of GABA-Aα5 receptors in mice induces spatial memory and learning impairment in a water maze ( 6 ). A significant increase in memory was observed in wild type mice treated with GABA-Aα5 selective inverse agonists ( 7 ). In a study of addictive behavior, the use of GABA-Aα5 inhibitors reduced alcohol-induced memory loss ( 8 ), while prenatal chronic alcohol exposure resulted in dysregulated expression of GABA-Aα5 and impaired learning and memory in offspring ( 9 ). Thus, GABA-Aα5 plays a very important role in the regulation of alcohol-dependent cognitive impairment. However, whether GABA-Aα5 is involved in the formation of alcohol addiction is unknown.
