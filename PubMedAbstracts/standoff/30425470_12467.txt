 CC-16 is a homodimeric pneumoprotein and it is mostly generated by nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells. 14 , 18 In vitro, ex vivo, and animal studies indicate that CC-16 plays a role in reducing inflammation of the airways and protecting the respiratory tract from oxidative stress. 14 , 18 Decreased serum levels of CC-16 have been found in smokers compared to nonsmokers, which might be attributable to smoking-induced club cell toxicity. 19 In COPD, CC-16 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum has been reported to be lower compared to controls. 19 , 20 CC-16 deficiency increases smoking-induced pulmonary inflammation. 21 Integrative genomics has shown CC-16 to be related to lung function decline in individuals with COPD. This supports CC-16 as a promising biomarker for its potential role in the pathogenesis of COPD. 22 Moreover, reduced CC-16 levels are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function over time, as well as COPD severity and progression. 19 , 23 Similar to previous studies, CC-16 was lower in patients with low FEV₁, DLCO, FVC, and FEV₁/FVC, which reflects the severity of obstruction and emphysema. This can be explained by the increased destruction of club cells in patients having chronic inflammatory airway diseases with severely impaired lung function.
