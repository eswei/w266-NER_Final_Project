 Increased NOTCH3 signaling in CADASIL VSMCs. To evaluate whether NOTCH3 mutation is associated with impaired Notch3 function and signaling, we assessed Notch3 receptor and Notch3 ECD (Notch3ᴱCᴰ) levels as well as NOTCH3-downstream gene targets in VSMCs from control and CADASIL patients. CADASIL VSMCs exhibited increased Notch3ᴱCᴰ accumulation (Figure 3A). Protein levels of Notch3 transmembrane/cytosolic fragment (TMIC) and NOTCH3 receptor gene expression were increased in CADASIL VSMCs relative to controls (Figure 3, B and C). Following receptor cleavage, the Notch3 ICD (Notch3ᴵCᴰ) translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of Notch target genes, including hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif–like protein (HEYL), nuclear receptor–interacting protein 2 (Nrip2), and glutamate receptor–interacting protein 2 (Grip2), which are involved in cell fate regulation. HEYL mRNA expression was increased in CADASIL VSMCs (Figure 3D). Expression of NOTCH3 and HEYL mRNA in CADASIL VSMCs was decreased to control levels when cells were pretreated with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), which inhibits Notch3 activation (Figure 3, C and D). No significant changes were observed for Nrip2 and Grip2 mRNA levels (Figure 3, E and F).
