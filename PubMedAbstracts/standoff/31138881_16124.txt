 We found no correlation between TK1 expression and FTD sensitivity in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of TK1 did not increase the sensitivity of cells to FTD. Other factors, in addition to the TK1 expression level, might determine FTD sensitivity. Indeed, nucleoside transporters (hENT1, hENT2 and hCNT1) ¹³ – ¹⁶ contribute to FTD cytotoxicity. Furthermore, nucleoside kinases, such as TMPK and NDK, are predicted to be involved in FTD phosphorylation. Hence, overexpression of TK1 alone is insufficient to increase the sensitivity of cells to FTD. On the other hand, doxycycline-inducible expression of TK1 increased FTD sensitivity in a doxycycline dose-dependent manner in cells with the same genetic background as TK1-knock-out cells. These results strongly indicate that the TK1 expression level highly correlates with cellular cytotoxicity to FTD in an isogenic background because the TK1 expression level was dependent on the doxycycline concentration and doxycycline did not affect cell growth or the cell cycle. Together, these data suggest that FTD would more effectively treat cancers with high TK1 expression than those with low TK1 expression.
