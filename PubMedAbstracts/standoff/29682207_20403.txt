 Differential expression was observed in key EC-associated genes between the Caucasian and BoAA cases; however, our analysis has identified several genes that have not been previously recognised to play a role in EC carcinogenesis. UTF1 had the greatest differential RNA expression between the BoAA and Caucasian populations. Increased expression of UTF1 (resulting from hypermethylation of its promoter) has been suggested as a biomarker of cervical cancer diagnosis, with inhibition of DNA methyltransferase by 5-aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine (also known as Decitabine) reducing UTF1 gene methylation and expression in two cervical cancer cell lines [ 27 ]. Furthermore, SLC14A2, which was significantly higher in both BoAA and Caucasian tumours compared to Asian cases has been shown to be down-regulated in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines [ 28 ], suggesting potential race-specific targets for treatment. The estrogen-target gene TFF1 was upregulated in BoAA tumors. TFF1 is known to play a role in breast cancer development [ 29 ] and bone metastasis [ 30 ], has also been suggested as a poor prognostic indicator associated with lymph node metastasis in pancreatic cancer [ 31 ]. A previous study has shown that a combination of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and the Ras inhibitor S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS, also known as Salirasib) inhibited tumor growth and enhanced type 2 EC cell death by reducing expression of ER-target genes, including TFF1 [ 32 ]. Since a large proportion of BoAA tumors are type 2 ECs, this presents a promising strategy for therapy in these patients.
