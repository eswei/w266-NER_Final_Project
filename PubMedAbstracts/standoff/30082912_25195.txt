 FGFs are produced by cancer cells or secreted by stromal compartment. Deregulation of FGF signaling has been found in both tumor cells and the cells in the tumorous environment [ 16 , 17 ]. FGFs binds to their receptors and triggers dimerization and cross-phosphorylation of the kinase domains, subsequently, downstream effectors are activated [ 18 ]. When FGF signaling is activated, the phosphorylated FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) recruits son of sevenless (SOS) and growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GFRB2), this complex further induces the activation of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway which mediates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration [ 17 , 19 ]. A couple of studies provided evidences to demonstrate the role of FGF members in different cancer types via ERK-MAPK signaling pathway. FGF2 was indicated to regulate the FGFR-ERK signaling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to accelerate tumor growth [ 20 ]. In hepatocellular carcinoma, FGF8 subfamily members, including FGF8, FGF17 and FGF18, were upregulated to facilitate cell survival and angiogenesis via activating ERK [ 21 ]. The involvement of FGF7 and FGF9 secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts were also demonstrated to promote migration and invasion of GC cells [ 22 , 23 ]. However, apart from paracrine manner, the secretion of FGFs by cancer cells themselves also contributes to cancer cell growth [ 24 ]. The function of FGF ligands secreted by GC cells remains unknown. In our study, FGF18 was demonstrated to be a prominent ligand released by GC cells which functions as a potential oncogene to promote gastric carcinogenesis. On one hand, downregulated FGF18 led to cell growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest. Herein, activation of ATM/γH2AX cascade and inactivation of TGF-β/SMAD signaling were revealed. It implied that DNA damage was caused by FGF18 knockdown, since the activation of ATM/γH2AX cascade was responsible for DNA double-strand break [ 25 ]. On the other hand, we also confirmed FGF18 derived CM significantly enhanced proliferation and invasion ability of GC cells. EMT properties were exhibited in the cells treated with FGF18-CM. TGF-β/SMAD signaling was proposed to play the mediated and crucial role in this process. It has been implicated that TGF-β/SMAD signaling accelerates cell migration, invasion, as well as EMT in the late stage of cancer [ 26 ]. One of the most prominent finding of FGFR in GC is the overexpression and amplification of FGFR2. It thus makes FGFR2 a significant prognostic and therapeutic target of GC [ 27 – 30 ]. Our results comprehensively delineated the detailed mechanisms of FGF18-FGFR2 signaling in gastric tumorigenesis.
