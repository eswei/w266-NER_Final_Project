 Since it was identified in several decades ago, ⁴⁰ the pivotal role of NF-κB signaling in various physiologic and pathologic diseases has been extensively reported. 41 , 42 Extensive studies have shown that NF-κB signaling was constitutively activated in a various types of human cancer and was involved in multiple process of cancer, including tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. 41 , 43 Several lines of evidence have reported that activation of NF-κB signaling is crucial for in the development of bone metastasis in cancers. 44 , 45 Importantly, unrestrained activity of NF-κB signaling has been reported to contribute to the metastatic phenotype of PCa progression, ²⁴ even in the bone metastasis of PCa. 25 , 26 Therefore, further clarifying the specific mechanisms responsible for constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling in the bone metastasis of PCa is of great urgency. In the current study, our results revealed that miR-204-5p was downregulated in bone metastatic PCa tissues, which in turn activated NF-κB signaling via simultaneously upregulating multiple important regulatory components of NF-κB signaling, including TRAF1, TAB3, and MAP3K3 in PCa. Importantly, inhibition of NF-κB signaling activity by LY2409881 and JSH-23 blocked the pro-metastasis roles of anti-miR-204-5p in invasion and migration abilities of PCa cells. Hence, our results provide a novel regulatory mechanism contributing to constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling in bone metastasis of PCa.
