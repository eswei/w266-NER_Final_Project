 Hepcidin is not only known as the regulator of iron homeostasis, but also as a prognostic marker in cancer entities: an increase in hepcidin expression was linked to patient’s outcome in prostate cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and RCC [ 1 – 3 , 9 – 12 ]. In patients with malignant breast cancer hepcidin serum levels were higher than in control patients [ 12 ]. Pinnix et al. have shown that human breast cancer tissue expresses hepcidin and ferroportin, the sole iron export channel in vertebrates: low ferroportin gene expression was associated with poor outcome, while a combination of high ferroportin and low hepcidin was associated with a good prognosis suggesting ferroportin may be a strong and independent predictor of prognosis in breast cancer [ 1 ]. In prostatic cancer an increase in serum hepcidin levels by 25 ng/ml predicted an increase in mortality by 10% [ 2 ]. Interestingly, human prostatic cancer cells produce hepcidin and have, as already described for breast cancer, a functional hepcidin/ferroportin regulatory axis, which contributes to prostate cancer survival [ 3 ]. In patients with colorectal cancer the expression of hepcidin in cancer tissue was related to T stage, but not to metastases [ 23 ]. In RCC, Kamai and colleagues have investigated hepcidin in a small cohort of patients suffering from RCC. The results are in line with the results obtained here: increased serum hepcidin levels were linked to metastasis of renal cell carcinoma [ 9 ].
