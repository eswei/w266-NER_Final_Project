 4. Targets of miR-126 in DSCs miRNAs modulate their target gene expression by binding to the 3′-UTR of the corresponding mRNA. Numerous studies have identified that miR-126 regulates key processes in different cancer types by targeting various genes, including insulin receptor substrate 1, v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog (CRK), CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) and sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2). As presented in Table I, the majority of these target genes are overexpressed in DSCs and function as oncogenes involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell senescence, differentiation, apoptosis and metastasis at both genetic and epigenetic levels. Therefore, miR-126 is an effective regulator of tumorigenesis and progression. VCAM-1 and PI3KR2 are associated with the anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic functions of pomegranate polyphenols in colon cancer ( 42 ). Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3), the target of miR-126 in ESCC, contributes to tumorigenicity and tumor cell proliferation ( 27 , 62 ). Several studies have demonstrated that miR-126 targets CXCR4 and suppresses its expression, which inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell apoptosis, and arrests the cell cycle at the G₀/G₁ transition ( 46 , 47 ). VEGF overexpression and neo-angiogenesis in CRC is associated with miR-126 downregulation ( 45 ). The oncogenic targets of miR-126 associated with HCC include the pro-angiogenic PI3KR2 ( 51 ) and EGFL7 ( 16 , 54 ), in addition to the pro-metastatic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) ( 51 ). Abnormally high expression of EGFL7 in HCC is also associated with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in HCC cells ( 54 ). ADAM9 overexpression in PC ( 61 ), regulator of G protein signaling 3 (RGS3) overexpression in GC ( 41 , 63 ) and aberrantly high levels of SOX2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ( 64 ) are all positively associated with cellular migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ( 56 ).
