 Top 10 methylated DMRs-genes: Obesity versus control pair Supplementary Table 5 presents top 10 hyper-methylated DMRs for obese/control pair, and the genes are RGPD5/RGPD8, CTDSPL2, GCNT1, LMO2, PGPEP1L, LDHA, CYB5R2, SPACA1, PARVG, and MSH6. Top 10 hypo-methylated DMRs for obese/control are listed in Supplementary Table 6. The annotated genes are LHX6, INPP5F, HIGD1A, SLC2A3 (GLUT3), BLCAP, NNAT, MATR3, SNHG4, CCDC144B, and DTX1 (gene underlined is also found for the Cancer versus control pair in Table 4). And, SLC2A3 was also on the top 10 hypo-methylated gene list in Cancer/control pair comparison, which suggested some association of obesity and CRC. It is worthy to notice that hyper-methylated DMRs are about evenly distributed in the CDS, promoter, intron and Utr5 regions; whereas, more regions of the hypo-methylated DMRs are in the promoter (40%), than intron (30%) and other three regions of CDS, Utr5 and three prime untranslated (Utr3) regions (10% each).
