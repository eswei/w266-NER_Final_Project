 In the present work, we studied for the first time the effect of diabetes on biochemical markers of sympathetic nerve terminals in the pineal gland. The level of NE and its precursors, DOPA and DA, were significantly reduced in diabetic pigs compared to control animals. Similarly, the content of DOPAC, a metabolite of DA, was also decreased. On the other hand, the level of VMA, a metabolite of NE, was significantly higher in diabetic pigs than in control pigs. Our results provide strong evidence that streptozotocin-induced diabetes influences sympathetic neurotransmission in the pig pineal gland. Two hypotheses related to these results should be considered. One possibility is that streptozotocin-induced diabetes leads to increased stimulation of sympathetic ganglion cells, the axons of which innervate the pineal gland. The release of NE is augmented for a long time, which is measurable as the increased level of VMA. Increased utilization of NE results in decreased levels of NE and its precursors. At the postsynaptic level, this overstimulation leads to increased levels of NAS (and perhaps melatonin for some period of time) and decreased levels of 5-HT. The second possibility is that diabetes induces pathological changes in the physiology of neurons innervating the pig pineal gland, leading to decreased synthesis and storage of catecholamines. Diabetes-induced neuropathy was observed in intrapineal nerve fibres containing tyrosine hydroxylase in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes [ 55 ]. The content of NE was lower in the pineal glands of diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats than in Wistar rats [ 26 ]. Further studies are needed to explain the significance and mechanism of changes in the content of catecholamines in the pig pineal gland with diabetes.
