 INTRODUCTION Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer, accounting for 1.8% of all cancer deaths in 2017; however, it has a poor prognosis, with only 27.4% survival after 5 years based on 2008–2014 data in the United States [ 1 ]. AML is caused by the replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells generated by the growth of abnormal white blood cells. Gradual mutations have been reported to occur during AML cell production from hematopoietic stem cells, in a manner similar to the multistep carcinogenesis model for colon and lung cancers [ 2 , 3 ]. The first target of the AML multi-mutations is DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), which is followed by mutations in the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and/or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) genes. Dovey et al. demonstrated that mutations of either NPM1 or FLT3 alone or both together caused AML in around 50% or 100%, respectively, of knock-in mice [ 4 ]. These mutations highly correlate with the generation of AML. Many chromosomal abnormalities are also observed in AML and produce molecular alterations by chromosome translocations, such as Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) 1–RUNX1T1, Core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFB)–myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11), promyelocytic leukemia (PML)–retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusions with various genes [ 5 ]. In addition, DNA methylation and histone modifications significantly contribute to leukemogenesis in AML. Thus, gene mutations, chromosome translocations, and epigenetic modifications are genetically noteworthy for understanding this malignancy.
