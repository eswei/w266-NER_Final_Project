 One protein of Kruppel-like zinc-finger proteins family, promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF), also known as ZBTB16, was first discovered in acute promyelocytic leukemia as a fusion protein with the retinoic acid receptor α ⁵ , ⁶ . PLZF is involved in diverse cellular processes, particularly in stem cells self-renewal or differentiation, and immune cells development ⁷ . Nevertheless, the role of PLZF appeared to be controversial in tumor progression. Several studies showed PLZF was able to reduce cell growth and survival in numerous cancers including melanoma, malignant mesothelioma, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer cells via c-myc suppression or poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Mcl-1 expression increase ⁸ – ¹³ . Importantly, low expression of cytoplasmic PLZF strongly correlated with high tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and indicated a short overall survival (OS) time in non-small cell lung cancer ¹⁴ . Meanwhile, Hur et al. claimed a tumor-promoting effect of PLZF by repressing the p53 pathway ¹⁵ . In thyroid carcinoma, high cytoplasmic expression of PLZF was found to be involved in capsular invasion and lymph node metastasis ¹⁶ . However, the role of PLZF in GBC has remained to be elucidated.
