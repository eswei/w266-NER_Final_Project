 Consistent with the results on short-term HA travelers published by others (Piperno et al., 2011 ), our results showed that hepcidin levels remained continuously low during chronic hypoxic exposure in long-term HA residents. Crucially, we found a remarkable decrease in hepcidin levels in patients with HAPC compared with healthy migrants who lived at the same altitude. Decreased hepcidin may be involved in the occurrence of excessive iron mobilization and subsequent runaway polycythemia among some HAPC patients, and this hypothesis is supported by the correlation analysis between the hepcidin levels and both serum iron concentrations and hemoglobin contents. The decrease in hepcidin is beneficial to the body if it is moderate and compatible with the physiological iron demand at high altitudes. However, greater decreases in hepcidin in HAPC may result in excessive iron absorption and the reuse and release of stored iron to exceed the iron demands of the body. It can be speculated that those without HAPC have controlled iron availability to synthesize hemoglobin. To a certain extent, iron deficiency limits the rate of erythrocyte formation and the development of HAPC. In contrast, it is easier for HAPC patients to obtain iron than others, particularly through the reuse of iron from damaged aging RBCs, as raw material for generating RBCs.
