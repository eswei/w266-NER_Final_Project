 SDHx germline mutations have been associated to different kind of tumors, mainly paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. SDHA (5p15.33) heterozygous pathogenic variants are related to an autosomal dominant inherited condition named paraganglioma syndrome type 5 (PGL5, OMIM 614165) associated to an increase in the risk of developing paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, GIST and pituitary adenomas [ 23 ]. The Carney-Stratakis syndrome (CSS) also known as GIST-paraganglioma dyad, (OMIM 606864) characterized by the presence of paraganglioma and GIST in the same individual, is related to germline mutations in SDHB, SDHC and SDHD, but its association with SDHA pathogenic mutations has been rarely recognized [ 24 ]. Carney triad (CT, OMIM 604287), first described in 1977, is characterized by the presence of gastric GISTs, paragangliomas and pulmonary chondromas, it’s almost always not inherited and it’s related to SDHC promoter hypermethylation [ 25 ]. Lastly, homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the SDHA have been occasionally related to the Leigh syndrome [ 26 ], a rare recessive disease characterized by neurodegenerative mitochondrial encephalomyopathy that becomes apparent mostly in the first year of life.
