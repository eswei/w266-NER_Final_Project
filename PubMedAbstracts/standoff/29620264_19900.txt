 Previously, recombinant TNF-Î± has been demonstrated to be beneficial in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer receiving PTX and cisplatinum ( 30 ). In the present study, PL-PTX treatment was associated with the suppression of ovarian cancer via activation of the TNF-caspase-3 cascade within ovarian cancer cells. Suyama et al ( 31 ) reported that ERK activation and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation may serve as markers of PTX sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma cells. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated PTX-induced apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells via inhibition of the ERK/AKT signaling pathway ( 32 ). In the present study, PTX induced ovarian cancer cell apoptosis via the induction of the TNF-mediated downregulation of ERK/AKT signaling pathway; a previous study proposed the association of the ERK/AKT signaling activation with cancer cell-resistance to PTX treatment ( 33 ). Additionally, a previous report demonstrated that upregulation of caspase-3 expression levels inhibits lung cancer metastasis and migration in a protease-independent manner via the downregulation of the ERK signaling pathway ( 34 ). The present study suggested that the ERK/AKT signaling pathway is involved in the activation of the TNF/caspase-3 cascade via PL-PTX within ovarian cancer cells.
