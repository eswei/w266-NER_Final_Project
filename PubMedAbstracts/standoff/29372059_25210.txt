 Conclusions This study is the first report that shows the prevalence and clinical impact of FVL and prothrombin G20210A mutations among Palestinian SCD patients. FVL was more prevalent among SS patients compared to normal subjects (control group). SCD patients with FVL showed a significantly higher incidence of pain in chest, abdomen and bone joints making these SCD patients dependent on regular blood transfusion to modify the vasoocclusive crises. The high frequency of FVL and its significant correlation with sickle cell anemia from Palestine could be an important risk factor for developing occlusive crisis. Studies that include a larger number of patients and controls are necessary to define specific guidelines. It is still possible that other inherited thrombophilic mutations may contribute to thrombotic complications in SCD. Mutations and polymorphisms in the fibrinogen gene, C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, C1565T mutation in the platelet glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) gene, and factor VII gene and others should be analyzed to determine the contribution of inherited thrombophilic mutations to thrombotic complications in patients with SCD.
