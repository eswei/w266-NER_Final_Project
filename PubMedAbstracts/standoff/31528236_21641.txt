 A novel lncRNA-LOC646762, located at 7p14.3, was a protective factor for adult AML patients, and overexpression of it predicted a favorable prognosis in risk stratification. In the present study, LOC646762, regulating co-expressed mRNA, may contribute to AML through the "endocytosis" signaling pathway. A previous study has demonstrated that the protein encoded by cyclin D3 (CCND3) belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, which affects the cell cycle by regulating the transition from G(1) to the S phase, and high CCND3 expression predicts a poor outcome in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 19 . The present study revealed that CCND3 is a risk factor for AML, and its overexpression predicts a poor prognosis. The protein encoded by carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family, which function as NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases 20 . A previous study demonstrated that low expression of CBR1 promotes growth and proliferation of ovarian cancer 21 . However, the present study indicated that overexpression of CBR1, a risk factor for AML, predicts an adverse outcome. C10orf54 is also known as V-set immunoregulatory receptor (VSIR) and its expression is significantly associated with tumor immune evasion in colorectal carcinoma tumors 22 . High expression of C10orf54 is related to a poor prognosis, but C10orf54 is a protective factor when LOC646762, CCND3, CBR1, CD97 and BLOC1S1 are expressed. Overexpression of CD97, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E5 (ADGRE5), in the leukemia stem cells of AML patients is associated with a poor prognosis 23 , which is in line with the results of the present study. Biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 1 subunit 1 (BLOC1S1) is a component of the BLOC1 multisubunit protein complex 24 . High expression of BLOC1S1 predicts an adverse outcome, while BLOC1S1 overexpression is correlated with a favorable prognosis when LOC646762, CCND3, CBR1, CD97 and BLOC1S1 are expressed. In summary, risk stratification for adult AML patients can be performed based on the combination of these six prognostic genes.
