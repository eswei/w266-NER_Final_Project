 In addition, the environment, e.g., vitamin D deficiency, also affects the development and clinical course of IBD[ 15 - 17 ]. Vitamin D deficiency has a high prevalence in IBD patients[ 17 , 18 ]. We have recently shown that clinical factors, e.g., the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± inhibitor, are associated with significant changes in vitamin D levels[ 19 ]. Vitamin D was originally mainly implicated in bone health, regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism[ 20 , 21 ], but recent evidence has shown that vitamin D also profoundly impacts the innate and adaptive immune system[ 22 - 24 ]. Underscoring its role in the pathogenesis of CD, vitamin D was shown to be an inductor of NOD2 gene expression[ 25 ]. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dendritic cells, Dionne et al[ 26 ] showed that 1, 25-vitamin D acts as a modulator of the innate immune system. However, little is known about the effects of vitamin D and the presence of NOD2 mutations on different gene expression levels in CD. The aim of our study was therefore to further characterize different gene expression profiles in CD patients and healthy controls correlating to NOD2 mutation status and vitamin D pretreatment. We identified different genes associated with the presence of CD and mutations in the NOD2 gene. Follow-up studies on these genes may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of CD and could contribute to the establishment of biomarkers to better predict the clinical course of the disease.
