 S100A8, which is a low molecular weight calcium-binding protein, is originally discovered as an immunogenic protein secreted by granulocytes and monocytes. S100A8 has emerged as an inflammatory factor and is associated with cancer. S100A8 is increasingly recognized as a biomarker in many solid tumors, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( 6 ), as well as colon ( 7 ), ovarian ( 8 ), bladder, and breast cancers ( 9 ). Recently, studies have shown that S100A8 is a potential indicator of poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ( 10 ), and increased mRNA levels of S100A8 were associated with progression in breast cancer ( 11 ). S100A8 and S100A9 usually form a heterodimer called calprotectin, which is expressed in immune cells infiltrating the breast cancer stroma ( 12 ). S100A8/A9 stimulates breast cancer progression by activating key signaling pathways, such as IL-6-JAK2-STAT3, TNF-α-CXCL1/2, TGF-β, NF-κB, and MAPK ( 12 , 13 ). A few studies have uncovered that individual S100A8 plays a vital role in poor prognosis of breast cancer. Infiltrating S100A8+ myeloid cells coordinated by macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) result in poor overall survival (OS) and shorter metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients ( 12 ). However, studies strongly suggest that S100A8 is expressed by cancer cells as well as by infiltrating immune and myeloid cells ( 14 ). The aim of this study was to examine the expression of S100A8 at the protein level in breast cancer cells.
