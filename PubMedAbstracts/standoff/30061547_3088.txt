 The link between obesity and ID may be attributable to adiposity-related inflammatory mediators on iron regulatory pathways. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), frequently elevated in obesity, has been shown to induce expression of hepcidin [ 13 ], a negative regulator of intestinal iron absorption, macrophage iron efflux and mobilisation of hepatic iron stores [ 14 ]. In non-pregnant obese women, hepcidin is upregulated [ 15 ]. During a healthy pregnancy, hepcidin is reduced, enabling increased iron transfer to the fetus [ 1 ]. It follows that obesity in pregnancy may lead to hepcidin excess and decreased iron transfer to the fetus. The relationship between maternal obesity, inflammation, and iron status has not been extensively examined, with recent conflicting results [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ]. Studies to date have been limited by small sample sizes and a lack of consensus regarding the measurement of iron and inflammatory biomarkers. There is also a paucity of studies examining the influence of maternal obesity on neonatal iron status, with some indicating that iron status may be compromised [ 16 , 17 , 21 , 22 , 23 ], and others reporting no impact [ 18 ].
