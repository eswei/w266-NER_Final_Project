 Results Genetic analyses We identified 13 consensus variants by WGS analysis (Table 1 and Additional file 1). Among them, 11 of the 13 variants were insertion/deletion, which might be misaligned false positive variant calls. The remaining two variants were MUC5B (c.7843G > A:p.G2615S) and LRRK2 (c.4322G > A:p.R1441H). Mucin 5B, oligomeric mucus/gelforming (MUC5B) has been reported as a susceptibility gene for pulmonary fibrosis [ 4 ]. Therefore, the results of WGS indicated that LRRK2 (c.4322G > A: p.R1441H) is a causative mutation for families A and B. Sanger sequencing validation identified eight symptomatic patients (A-II-2, A-II-3, A-II-5, A-II-6, A-II-7, B-III-2, B-III-6, and B-III-8) with p.R1441H, and four asymptomatic individuals (A-II-1, A-II-9, A-III-1, B-III-3) without p.R1441H, which signals complete segregation of p.R1441H in families A and B (Fig. 1b). In addition, Sanger sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in five patients (A-II-3, A-II-5, A-II-6, B-III-6, and B-III-8) and a heterozygous mutation in three patients (A-II-2, A-II-7, and B-III-2; Additional file 1: Figure S1). There were no pathogenic mutations, as well as risk variants and haplotypes, including SNCA, PAKR16, BST1, and MAPT, related to familial PD except LRRK2 p.R1441H in our WGS reads. Haplotype analysis indicated that patients from families A and B shared a common haplotype in the region of between D12S2080 and D12S2522, which signals a founder effect (Additional file 1: Table S2).
