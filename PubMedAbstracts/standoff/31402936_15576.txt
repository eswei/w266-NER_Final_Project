 A retrospective analysis of clinical data of 182 NSCLC patients and 200 healthy individuals was performed. The results of RT-qPCR detection showed that the expression level of hOGG1 was significantly higher in cancer tissues than that in adjacent tissues in NSCLC group of patients, with a statistically significant difference. The median value of the hOGG1 expression level in detection results as the boundary, NSCLC patients were divided into hOGG1 high expression group and hOGG1 low expression group. The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates of patients in hOGG1 low expression group were significantly higher than those in hOGG1 high expression group. AUC of hOGG1 expression in the survival prediction of patients with NSCLC was 0.816 which is a high predictive value. Studies have reported that the expression of most oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can affect the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells, correlated with the occurrence and development and prognosis of tumors ( 20 ). As a glycosidase that repairs oxidative DNA damage in humans, hOGG1 is closely related to the maintenance of the normal function of human genes and the occurrence and development of cancers ( 21 ). hOGG1 gene polymorphism has been reported to be important in a variety of digestive system cancers, closely related to the prognosis of various cancers. hOGG1 gene can inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells and the growth of lung cancer tumors ( 22 ). According to studies by Zhou et al ( 23 ), the hOGG1 expression in serum of patients with acute leukemia depression is higher than that in normal patients, which further supports our experimental results.
