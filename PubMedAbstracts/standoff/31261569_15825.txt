 In gastrointestinal tumors, mesothelin expression is a poor prognostic factor.[ ³⁰ ] Co-expression of mesothelin and CA125 was associated with poor patient prognosis in pancreatic cancer.[ ⁷ ] Luminal membrane expression of mesothelin was one of the poor prognostic factors in gastric cancer.[ ⁸ ] Intracellular mesothelin expression correlated with poor patient prognosis in extrahepatic bile duct cancer.[ ³¹ ] In several studies, the expression pattern of mesothelin is divided into luminal and non-luminal patterns. In a 2014 study, luminal staining of mesothelin was correlated with poor prognostic factors in colorectal adenocarcinoma.[ ¹⁹ ] In another recent study, a luminal pattern of mesothelin expression was not associated with CSS and poor prognostic factors; however, a non-luminal pattern of mesothelin expression was associated with CSS and poor prognostic factors, such as tumor budding, high histologic grading, and lymph node metastasis.[ ²⁰ ] In the present study, a completely luminal pattern of staining was observed only in cases with weak intensity, while both luminal and non-luminal patterns were observed simultaneously in cases with moderate to strong positive staining. A score of 2 (moderate to strong expression in ≥30% of tumor cells) was considered as high expression. As a result, cases with only a luminal pattern were considered to have low expression, and non-luminal pattern was associated with poor prognostic factors. These findings are consistent with a previous study; although not statistically significant, our study also showed shorter CSS in patients with mesothelin overexpression.[ ²⁰ ]
