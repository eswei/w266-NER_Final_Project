 Many studies have investigated the functional mechanisms of lncRNA BLACAT1 on tumorigenesis and progression in various cancers. Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway has been confirmed to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in certain cancers [ 25 , 26 ]. Wang et al. reported that knockdown of lncRNA BLACAT1 might inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells by suppressing the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway [ 24 ]. Cdk inhibitors (CKIs) may regulate the kinase activity of Cdk/cyclin complexes and generally function as tumor suppressors. Su et al. identified that lncRNA BLACAT1 was a critical player in the cell cycle of colorectal cancer via modulating the expression of P15 (a member of CKIs family) [ 23 ]. Furthermore, a study by Ye et al. demonstrated that lncRNA BLACAT1 may promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of non-small-cell lung cancer cell by sponging miR-144 [ 21 ], which is an important member of tumor-suppressive microRNAs [ 27 , 28 ]. Otherwise, several studies also have reported that lncRNA BLACAT1 may be involved in chemoresistance. Huang et al. indicated that lncRNA BLACAT1 could regulate autophagy and promote chemoresistance of non-small-cell lung cancer cells via miR-17/ATG7 axis [ 29 ]. Wu et al. demonstrated that BLACAT1 promoted the oxaliplatin-resistance of gastric cancer through BLACAT1/miR-361/ABCB1 regulatory pathway, providing a brand new insight for the oxaliplatin-resistance of gastric cancer [ 30 ]. All the findings concluded that lncRNA BLACAT1 might be a promising therapeutic target for cancers.
