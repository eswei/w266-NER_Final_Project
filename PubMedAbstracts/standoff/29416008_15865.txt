 BA is a typical cholestatic neonatal disease that is a leading liver disease caused death in infants ¹⁹ , ²⁰ . We here found that strong mitochondrial structure alterations and loss of the MMP in the livers of BA patients, suggests the bile acids induce mitochondrial destruction or damages in cholestatic livers. Simultaneously, we observed that autophagosomes and mitophagosomes increased significantly in livers of BA patients compared to control subjects. In addition to, both the mRNA levels and the protein levels of the essential autophagy genes were significantly increased in livers of BA patients. These results suggest that the cholestasis is associated with increased-mitophagy in cholestatic livers. However, the link between cholestasis and mitophagy is unknown. In livers, newly synthesized bile acids were conjugated with either glycine or taurine, generating TCDCA, GCDCA, TCA, and GCA. We recently reported that hepatic bile acids, TCDCA, GCDCA, TCA, and GCA in BA patients were greatly increased compared to the controls ¹⁷ . In this study, we showed that TCDCA, GCDCA, TCA, and GCA were the most abundant bile acids in the hepatic mitochondria, and they were increased significantly in the hepatic mitochondria of BA patients compared to control subjects. In vitro, we confirmed that TCDCA, GCDCA, TCA, and GCA could tightly bind to hepatic mitochondria. In line with the established major hepatocellular toxicity of GCDCA and TCDCA in cells and whole-organ models ⁴ , we here demonstrated that the bile acids GCDCA and TCDCA have toxic potential to liver mitochondria by enhancing mitochondrial permeability.
