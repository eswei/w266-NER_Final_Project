 LINC00673 is located on chromosome 17q24.3, which exhibits a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity [ 36 ]. In 2011, a rs11655237 C>T variant was first documented by Cabiliet et al. [ 37 ]. Later, a GWAS showed rs11655237 C>T to be associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility [ 30 ]. A subsequent study by Zheng et al. [ 38 ] confirmed the relationship between rs11655237 and the risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a Chinese population and shed light on the molecular mechanism by which the polymorphism confers PDAC risk. They found that the C-to-T shift at rs11655237 creates a target site for miR-1231 binding and interferes with ubiquitination and degradation of PTPN11. They also demonstrated that the rs11655237 T allele can impair LINC00673 activity, thereby triggering SRC-ERK oncogenic signaling and ultimately resulting in a higher risk for developing PDAC. Intriguingly, LINC00673 functions as a tumor suppressor or promoter in different cancer types. Huang et al. [ 29 ] found that LINC00673 is upregulated in gastric cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis. Investigation into the mechanism suggested that LINC00673 is activated by SP1 and exerts oncogenic effects in part through interaction with LSD1 and EZH2. Lu et al. [ 39 ] also identified LINC00673 as an oncogenic mediator in non-small cell lung cancer. They demonstrated that LINC00673 promotes non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition by sponging miR-150-5p. In addition, research conducted by Yu et al. [ 40 ] showed that LINC00673 is highly expressed in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma and correlates with a poor prognosis. Up to now, however, the possible activity of LINC00673 in neuroblastoma remained unexplored.
