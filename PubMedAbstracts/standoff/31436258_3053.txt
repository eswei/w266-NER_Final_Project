 MNX1 is located on human chromosome 7q36.3 and is a member of the EHG homeobox genes family [ 11 , 12 ]. As a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, MNX1 is involved in numerous types of pathological progression. It is generally accepted that Currarino syndrome is primarily caused by MNX1 deletion or mutation, which suggests that MNX1 affects human development and cell transformation [ 13 , 14 ]. In addition, MNX1 was reported to be overexpressed in several cancers [ 15 , 16 ]. It was proposed that MNX1 is upregulated in poorly differentiated liver cancer [ 17 ]. In 2016, Das reported that MNX1 is a novel prostate cancer oncogene, acting partially via promoting lipid synthesis [ 18 ]. Consistent with the above findings, Zhang et al. reported MNX1 was oncogenically upregulated in African-American patients with prostate cancer [ 19 ]. In 2016, a study published in Nature performed an integrated genomic analysis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and found that MNX1 was overexpressed in pancreatic progenitor tumors [ 20 ]. Chen et al. detected high MNX1 expression in bladder cancer cell lines and bladder cancer tissues and confirmed that high MNX1 was correlated with shorter 5-year overall survival [ 21 ]. Recently, it was reported that MNX1 was associated with tumor size, receptor status, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in breast cancer [ 22 ]. Taken together, MNX1 upregulation is involved in progression of several cancers, which indicates MNX1 probably is an oncogene. Until now, the roles of MNX1 in cervical cancer have been unclear.
