 It has been reported that activation of Akt by a PI3K dependent mechanism can stimulate translocation of the GLUT4 [ 38 ]. Here, reductions of total PI3K abundances and its phospho-PI3K p85ᵀʸʳ⁴⁵⁸/p55ᵀʸʳ¹⁹⁹ subunit were detected in the IUGR offsprings. The level of phospho-AktSᵉʳ⁴⁷³ was also reduced in the IUGR offsprings. These data implied a significant inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling activity in the IUGR offsprings. PTEN, as a negative regulator, is responsible for suppression of Akt activation by dephosphorylating phosphoinositide substrates [ 39 , 40 ]. As expected, a significant increase of the PTEN level was detected in the IUGR offsprings. Interestingly, it has been reported that increased PTEN expression is associated with the development of insulin resistance [ 41 ]. Loss-of-function PTEN mutations in adipose tissue results in systemic glucose tolerance and improvement of insulin sensitivity because of increased recruitment of the GLUT4 towards the membrane [ 42 ]. In glucosamine-induced insulin-resistant skeletal muscle cells, the rate of glucose uptake as well as the expression and translocation of GLUT4 were decreased, whereas the expressions of PTEN and phospho-PTEN were increased [ 43 ]. In combination with our findings, it suggests that PTEN may be a promising target for pharmacological interventions aimed at reversing insulin resistance in individuals with IUGR.
