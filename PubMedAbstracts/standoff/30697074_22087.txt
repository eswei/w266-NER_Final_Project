 To explore the effects of PUF60 in the progression of breast cancer, we carried out gain-/loss-of-function assays. Results showed that PUF60 overexpression significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells, as well as repressed cell apoptosis, indicating that PUF60 functions as an oncogene, which promotes the malignant progression of breast cancer. PUF60 is a splicing variant of FIR that lacks the exon 5, which consists of 17 amino acids. 22 Identically to FIR, PUF60 is identified to be a transcriptional repressor of c-Myc gene, which is critically activated in tumorigenesis in various tumors, 23 – 25 and the exon 2 of FIR/PUF60 plays an indispensable role in this process. 26 However, in several kinds of cancers such as NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, 7 , 21 , 27 – 29 FIR is alternatively spliced lacking exon 2 (FIRΔᵉˣᵒⁿ²), which functions as a dominant negative form of authentic FIR. 7 Additionally, FIR/PUF60 and FIRΔᵉˣᵒⁿ² have been reported to be upregulated in various malignant tumors, including colon cancer, 28 hepatocellular carcinoma, 29 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 30 and lung cancer. 21 For instance, high expressed FIR was significantly enriched at the invasion type of primary NSCLCs and siRNA-mediated knockdown of all FIR variants obviously decreased the speed and directional movement of tumor cells, as well as the sprouting efficiency and single cell invasiveness. 21 Noticeably, silencing of FIR-Δᵉˣᵒⁿ² alone was sufficient to reduce cell migration and invasion. 21 And in the present study, we explored the function of PUF60 only (not FIRΔᵉˣᵒⁿ²) in breast cancer progression and found it functioned as an oncogene in breast cancer.
