 In this study, the expression of FINS and HOMA-IR increased in patients with diabetes and overweight/obesity, whereas that of HDL-C and adiponectin decreased; the FFA levels in patients with GDM increased. In the non-overweight/obese women, VDR mRNA, PPAR mRNA, and HOMA-IR were related to GDM, while in the women with overweight/obesity, HDL-C and FFA levels were related to GDM. VDR/PPARγ expression correlated to the glucose levels and lipid metabolism. Herrera and Desoye[ ³² ] has shown that lipid metabolism is abnormal in diabetic patients, IR exists in the adipose tissue of obese and diabetic pregnant women, and adipose tissue plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes.[ ¹² ] VDR levels positively correlate with IR,[ ³³ ] Pregnant women with high pre-pregnancy BMI or GDM have impaired FFA transport at the mother-fetal interface,[ ³⁴ ]GDM and FFA levels also correlate with IR,[ ³⁵ ] adiponectin is an adipokine and an endogenous insulin sensitizer that reduces the circulating level of insulin in patients obesity and diabetes. Mousa et al[ ³⁶ ] showed that the baseline concentration of 25(OH)D negatively correlated with TC /TG and positively correlated with adiponectin in 102 high-risk women with overweight or obesity. Adiponectin can up-regulate the PPARγ expression through by regulating the insulin content and insulin secretion, and decreased levels of adiponectin in the circulation of obese individuals may be directly associated with the β-cell dysfunction in T2DM.[ ³⁷ ]
