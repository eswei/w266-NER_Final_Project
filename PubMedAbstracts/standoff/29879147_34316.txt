 Previous studies have further proposed an association between the NOTCH pathway and inflammation [ 22 , 30 ]. Indeed, in both drugâ€“induced SD models presented, we have observed an up-regulation of genes involved in inflammation and repair, including IL16 (FDR<0.05 in both models) and CCL2 (FDR<0.05 in anti-DLL4 model and with higher FDR in oxaliplatin model). Up-regulation of TGFB1 was also evident in our anti-DLl4-induced SD NHP model (FDR<0.05). IL16 is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is a chemoattractant for CD4+ immune cells [ 31 ] though not previously associated with drug-induced SD. Recently, novel physiological functions of IL16 in vascular smooth muscle cells, including IL16-induced MMP9 expression, have been described [ 32 ]. IL16 has also been shown to be an inflammatory mediator involved in cardiotoxicity; increased IL16 expression in the heart of transgenic mice was shown to result in cardiac fibrosis, left ventricle myocardial stiffening, and increased macrophage infiltration [ 33 ]. CCL2, on the other hand, is NOTCH pathway dependent [ 30 ]. Shen et al. have recently demonstrated the importance of DLL4 in liver disease and its role in the modulation of liver inflammatory response by down-regulation of CCL2 chemokine expression [ 30 ]. A trend towards up-regulation of CCL2 in CRLM patients with oxaliplatin-induced SD (FDR<0.25) and up-regulation of CCL2 in NHPs with anti-DLL4-induced SD (FDR<0.05), further suggest involvement of the NOTCH pathway in the pathogenesis of drug-induced SD. Finally, CCL2 has previously been shown to be up-regulated in CRLM patients with oxaliplatin-induced SD [ 34 ].
