 Wnt/β-catenin exhibits complicated effect on both the development of stem cells and cancers 35 - 38 . In the HF, the transit-amplifying matrix compartment appears to be the target for malignant transformation by mutational activation of the Wnt cascade 39 . Constitutive activation of β-catenin in HFs induces pilomatricoma-like lesions, where the exterior zone of the tumor is composed of densely packed cells resembling the matrix of HFs 40 . Another HF tumor, namely trichofolliculoma, was developed in tamoxifen-inducible β-catenin transgene mice 41 . Notably, the most spontaneous pilomatricomas in humans are featured with activating mutations in β-catenin 42 . Recent evidence has shown that in many organs, such as the HF, resident adult stem cells can be the initiating cells for cancers 43 , 44 . In this study, deletion of both Pten and β-catenin in Lgr5⁺ HFSCs result in reduced HF hyperplasia and SCC development. Together with the in vitro data, our study support that the effect of β-catenin is downstream of Pten/Akt signaling in the initiation and development of SCC. However, more studies with gain and lose function of β-catenin and Pten/Akt signaling in HFSCs are desired, to further explore the crosstalk between Pten/Akt and β-catenin and its role in skin cancer development. In addition, our data suggest that TNF plays an essential role in Pten loss in HFSCs induced hyperplasia and SCC development. However, the relationship between TNF and Pten/Akt signaling in HFSCs activation and SCC development was still largely unknown. Given the evidence of TNF as a key component of HFSCs activation 4 , 45 , TNF and Pten/Akt signaling pathways possibly exhibit synergistic effect on SCC development via activating and transforming HFSC, respectively.
