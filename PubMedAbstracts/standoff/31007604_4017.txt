 Dysregulation of chemokines and cytokines may contribute to dysfunction of immune surveillance mechanisms assumed to be able to avoid autoimmunity. T cells can be divided into T helper cell (Th) 1 (IFN-γ), Th2 (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10), Th9 (IL-9), Th17 (IL-17), and regulatory T cell (Treg) (IL-10 and TGF-β) lineages. Studies suggested that SLE has an impact on both the Th1/Th2 and the Th17/Treg paradigm [ 1 , 7 ]. Macrophage chemotactic protein- (MCP-) 1, also known as CCL2, potentially promotes migration of cells including T cells, basophils, dendritic cells, and monocytes to the site of tissue injury [ 8 ]. Previous studies demonstrated that serum levels of MCP-1 were correlated with active lupus nephritis [ 9 ]. High levels of sTNFR are indicative of frequent cleavage of the TNF receptors in some diseases, such as SLE-related autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) [ 10 ]. CCL17 (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, TARC) is a ligand for CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), a chemokine receptor predominantly expressed by Th2 cells. It has been previously suggested that the elevation of plasma CCL17 levels is closely related to the development of SLE [ 11 , 12 ]. CCL20 (MIP-3a), produced by Th17 cells, recruits inflammatory cells including lymphocytes and macrophages. Th17 response is increased via producing this chemokine. Patients with new-onset SLE have high levels of CCL20 which is correlated with disease activity [ 13 ]. However, how these molecules behave in a regulatory network in the pathogenesis of SLE awaits further clarification.
