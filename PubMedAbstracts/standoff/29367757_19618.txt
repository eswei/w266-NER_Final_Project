 The FGF pathways can be regulated by miRNAs, through directly targeting the ligands or receptors. ³¹ For example, miR-338 directly regulates FGFR2 expression in osteoblasts, miR-424 and miR-503 directly suppress FGF2 and FGFR1 expression in pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and miR-710 is a direct regulator of FGF15 expression in myofibroblasts. Dysfunction of miRNA regulation of FGF signaling can also result in cancer progression. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for example, down regulation of miR-152 and miR-198 leads to increased levels of FGF2 and FGFR1 respectively, leading to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation and invasion. In breast cancer, reduced expression of miR-503 results in increased FGF8 and consequent increased angiogenesis and proliferation. In the present study, we identified 59 microRNAs that were up-regulated and 43 that were suppressed by FGFR1 signaling, including well known oncomiRNAs miR-27a, ³² miR-210, ³³ miR-155, ³⁴ miR-483 ³⁵ and the miR-17/92 cluster. ³⁶ – ⁴¹ In addition, miR-26a/b, ⁴² miR-150, ⁴³ , ⁴⁴ miR-433 ⁴⁵ and miR-503, ⁴⁶ likely function as tumor suppressors in SCLL neoplasms. Consistent with this speculation, over expression of miR-17/92 only partially rescued the cells from BGJ398 induced cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis, implying the involvement of other miRNAs in FGFR1 fusion kinase driven SCLL. These observations reveal an integrative picture of microRNAs and components of the FGFR signaling pathway to orchestrate development and differentiation.
