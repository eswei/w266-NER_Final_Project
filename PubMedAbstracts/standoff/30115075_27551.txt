 Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study that compared clinical and pathological differences among patients grouped based on Fib deposition levels. The data indicate that HSPN children with glomerular Fib deposition, especially those with severe Fib deposition, have more severe inflammatory reactions, hypercoagulability and disordered immune functions; glomerular damage in these patients may also be more severe.
