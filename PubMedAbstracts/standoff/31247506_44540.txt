 In summary, NOX4 expression and function are regulated in a cell compartment-specific manner in the context of CKD. We clearly demonstrate that although glomerular NOX4 expression may be enhanced in some nephropathies, loss of tubular NOX4 is a hallmark of all types of CKD. Overexpression of NOX4 in the tubular compartment did not induce injury or fibrosis and rather induced the NRF2 pathway mildly, further demonstrating that NOX4-derived ROS are not harmful in tubular cells, in contrast to what is known in podocytes. NOX4 overexpression did not modify the course of a fibrotic disease such as UUO. While NOX4 emerges as a potential therapeutic target, its functions appear to be cell compartment specific and caution should be taken with regard to systemic NOX4 inhibition. The role of tubular NOX4 as a marker of the severity and prognosis of kidney disease should be studied further.
