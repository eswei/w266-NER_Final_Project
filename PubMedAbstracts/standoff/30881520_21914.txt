 In patients with CPT-I deficiency, synthesis of long-chain acylcarnitines from acyl-CoA and carnitine is impaired. Thus, free carnitine levels increased, and long-chain acylcarnitine levels decreased in mitochondria. In contrast, medium-chain fatty acids are transported into mitochondria independent of CPT-I and can be used to treat patients with CPT-I deficiency. In our test, values of d₇-C4 and d₃₁-C16 in PBMCs of patients with CPT-I deficiency decreased compared with those in controls after incubation with d₃₁-hexadecanoic acid (Table S2). However, in controls, d₃₁-C16 levels were distributed over a wide range and sometimes fell to low levels, possibly due to low cell counts or decreased cell viability. Therefore, to clearly distinguish CPT-I-deficient cells from control cells with low viability, we performed two different loading tests using only d₃₁-hexadecanoic acid or both d₁₅-octanoic acid and d₃₁-hexadecanoic acid. After incubation with two labeled fatty acids, d₇-C4 increased despite the low d₃₁-C16 levels, and the d₇-C4/d₃₁-C16 ratio was significantly elevated in patients compared with controls. Furthermore, a comparison of the d₇-C4/d₃₁-C16 ratios between those tests clearly showed the differences between patients and controls and seemed to be useful for diagnosis of CPT-I deficiency.
