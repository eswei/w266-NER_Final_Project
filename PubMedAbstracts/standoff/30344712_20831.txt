 To investigate the association between tumor volume and blood cystatin-C levels, the cystatin-C levels were compared with the number of metastases. Cystatin-C was observed to be at the lowest levels subsequent to surgery, when the tumor had been removed, with the levels increasing as the number of metastases increases. As in the immunohistochemical analysis, paired comparisons were performed between cystatin-C levels prior and subsequent to surgery in 6 patients. Whilst these patients did not show serum positivity, the absolute blood levels of cystatin-C decreased subsequent to surgery compared with the time of diagnosis, suggesting levels are dependent upon the tumor volume. Similarly in ovarian cancer, cystatin-C has been reported to increase only in patients with cancer, not in healthy individuals and patients with benign ovarian disease ( 25 ). By contrast, cystatin-C levels were low in prostate cancer specimens compared with benign tissues. Wegiel et al ( 26 ) observed an inverse correlation between the expression of cystatin-C and matrix metalloproteinase 2. Similarly, the present study did not find any patients with prostate cancer to be cystatin-C positive, suggesting a functional specificity of cystatin-C in different types of cancer, due to the presence of different co-functioning molecules. Cystatin-C is a TGF-β receptor antagonist in addition to a cystatin-C-mediated feedback loop that inhibits TGF-β signaling ( 27 ). By inhibiting oncogenic TGF-β signaling, cystatin-C is effective in preventing breast cancer angiogenesis and progression ( 28 ).
