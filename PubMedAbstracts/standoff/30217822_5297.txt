 Genetic variants in FH are associated with disease ( 34 ). In AMD, FH SCR-7 harbors the AMD-risk polymorphism Y402H ( 7 â€“ 10 ). Individuals homozygous for His-402 have a 6-fold increased risk of developing AMD compared with 2.5-fold for His-402 heterozygotes ( 35 ). The presence of His-402 weakened heparin binding to both FH SCR-6/8 and full-length FH ( 36 , 37 ), FH binding to CRP ( 38 , 39 ), and full-length FH binding to HS in Bruch's membrane ( 40 ). For the development of AMD, age-related changes in glycosaminoglycan structures such as a decrease in the sulfation of HS, together with the presence of FH His-402, have been proposed to reduce FH binding over time. At host cell surfaces, FH His-402 showed weaker SCR-7 binding to eye tissue-specific HS only ( 41 ). In opposition to these observations of weaker HS binding for the His-402 allotype, His-402 in SCR-6/8 was seen to be bound to the highly-sulfated glycosaminoglycan analogue sucrose octasulfate using X-ray crystallography, whereas no such crystals were reported for the Tyr-402 allotype ( 42 ). Although the statistical association of Y402H with AMD is one of the strongest, many other complement variants in CFH and other complement genes associate also with AMD, suggesting that AMD is caused by several different molecular mechanisms. For example, at the other heparin-binding site on FH, SCR-20 harbors the AMD-risk rare variant R1210C ( 43 ). AMD is associated with another 12 rare variants in FH in its signal peptide or in SCR-1, SCR-3/5, SCR-8, SCR-16, or SCR-18 ( 44 ). AMD is also associated with the protective polymorphism V62I in SCR-1 ( 10 , 45 ), common synonymous and noncoding variants in a region overlapping the CFH gene ( 36 , 46 , 47 ), and genetic variants in complement C3, CFI, CFB, and C9 ( 44 , 49 ).
