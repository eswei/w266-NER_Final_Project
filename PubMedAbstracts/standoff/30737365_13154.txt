 Cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) is a member of the type I cytokeratin protein genes and a cell structural protein coding for intermediate filament acidic proteins [ 25 ]. CK-19 is expressed in most epithelial cells and many types of malignancies such as lung and esophageal cancers [ 26 – 28 ]. The function and role of CK-19 in endometriosis have yet to be clarified. CK-19 can be detected in epithelial cells of the endometrium in women with and without endometriosis, as well as in endometriotic lesions [ 29 ]. CK-19 can also be detected in menstrual fluid, peritoneal fluid, normal peritoneum, urine, and ectopic endometriotic lesions from women with endometriosis [ 8 , 30 ]. CYFRA 21-1 is a CK-19 fragment that is soluble in serum and may be a useful circulating tumor marker [ 31 ]. A recent study using proteomic techniques and mass spectrometry in Australia revealed that urine CYFRA 21-1 was highly upregulated in the urine of women with endometriosis [ 8 ]. However, the study could not explain the mechanism of how urine CYFRA 21-1 was upregulated. Another prospective study that evaluated serum and urine CYFRA 21-1 in endometriosis reported no differences in serum or urine CYFRA 21-1 levels between women with and without endometriosis [ 7 ]. Similarly, in our results, serum CYFRA 21-1 level was not different between women in the endometriosis group and the control group. A lower CYFRA 21-1 level (≤2.29 ng/mL) was more frequently observed in women with endometriosis than the control. The diagnostic accuracy of serum CYFRA 21-1 for endometriosis was comparable to that of CA125. Specifically, the sensitivity of serum CYFRA 21-1 was significantly higher than that of CA125. In addition, the combination of serum CYFRA 21-1 and CA125 for diagnosing endometriosis showed comparable sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and better PPV to those of CA125.
