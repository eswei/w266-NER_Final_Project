 Platinum-based drugs, particularly cisplatin, are first-line chemotherapy drugs ( 30 ). miRNAs are involved into the mechanism of cisplatin for the treatment of cancer ( 14 , 31 , 32 ). The epigenetic regulation of insulin like growth factor 1 receptor via miR-1294 is important for cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer ( 32 ). miR-539 can increase the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin treatment by directly targeting DCLK1 ( 14 ). miR-363 may be a biomarker for predicting responsiveness to cisplatin-based chemotherapy by snail-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial ovarian cancer cells ( 31 ). Although these studies support that miRNAs participate in the anticancer roles of cisplatin for the treatment of cancer, the effects of cisplatin on the proliferation of lung cancer cells require further investigation. Previous studies found that miR-93, miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-29a, miR-29c and miR-125 play important roles in cancer ( 22 â€“ 24 ). The present study investigated the roles of these miRNAs in the cisplatin-induced suppression of lung cancer and demonstrated that cisplatin could effectively inhibit lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism by which cisplatin inhibits lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation is proposed to be associated with the expression of miR-93 and miR-26a.
