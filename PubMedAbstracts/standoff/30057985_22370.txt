 Elevated plasma levels of several cytokines and chemokines were detected in ET, PMF and PV patients compared to healthy subjects. This finding indicates that an inflammatory process may be involved in the physiopathology of MPN, as cytokines and chemokines act in autocrine, paracrine and endocrine manners, and may even affect the hematopoietic niche. The levels of two regulatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, were increased in all patient groups, which suggests an attempt to counterbalance the excessive pro-inflammatory response. In addition, the levels of cytokine/chemokine expression differed between the three MPN groups. For instance, PMF patients exhibited higher plasma levels of IFN-γ, IL-12p70 and IL-17A than ET patients and higher plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-4, IL12-p70 and GM-CSF than PV patients. ET patients exhibited higher plasma levels of RANTES than CTRLs and PV, as well as higher levels of MIP-1β than PV patients. IL-12 and IL-17 are pro-inflammatory cytokines that participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses and whose altered levels have been correlated to the physiopathology of various diseases, including cancer. 26 , 27 , 28 RANTES, an important chemokine associated with cancer progression and metastasis, acts as a growth factor, stimulates angiogenesis and participates in immune evasion mechanisms. 29 , 30 In this context, the increased levels of IL-12p70, IL-17A and RANTES in PMF patients suggest that they bear a more intense inflammatory process than ET or PV patients do.
