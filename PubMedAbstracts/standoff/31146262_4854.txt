 Fifteen m.3243A>G carriers with different stages of glucose intolerance were studied with both OGTT and hyperinsulinemic clamp. In these patients, both decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired β-cell function was demonstrated prior to development of overt diabetes ( 20 ). Insulin sensitivity was equally reduced in all m.3243A>G carriers while the insulin secretion defect progressed from non-diabetic over the newly diagnosed diabetic to the carriers with an average diabetes duration of 9.7 years ( 20 ). In the same group of subjects, insulin resistance was found in adipose tissue with decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, blunted suppression of lipolysis and low adiponectin levels ( 21 ). Insulin resistance has also been reported in other studies, although only in mutation carriers with manifest diabetes, which suggests that insulin resistance could be caused by glucose toxicity rather than mitochondrial dysfunction ( 19 , 22 , 23 ). This is in contrast to a study of 12 diabetic carriers, which did not detect insulin resistance using the euglycemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp ( 24 ). Increased gluconeogenesis related to elevated lactate levels has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diabetes ( 23 ). In addition, insulin response to arginine showed normal values, indicating a preservation of the β-cell population despite impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( 19 ).
