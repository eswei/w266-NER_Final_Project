 In our previous study investigating global profiling of gene expression in RCC cells with different metastatic potential, we found that follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) was frequently down-regulated in metastatic ccRCC [ 19 ]; and the C allele of rs1259293 in the coding region of FSLT1 was associated with an increased risk and unfavorable postoperative prognosis of RCC, possibly by down-regulating FSTL1 expression in renal tissues [ 20 ]. FSTL1, a secreted glycoprotein encoded on chromosome 3 in humans, is widely expressed in cells of non-hematopoietic lineage, particularly in cells of the mesenchymal lineage [ 21 ]. FSTL1 is induced in response to inflammatory injuries and plays important roles in promoting the accumulation of myofibroblasts and subsequent fibrosis, promoting cardiac function, and reducing glomerular and tubulointerstitial inflammatory damage in the kidney via attenuating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines [ 22 – 24 ]. The role of FSTL1 in cancers is controversial. During cancer metastasis from the primary site to the bone, FSTL1 mediates cancer cell invasion and expands a population of bone marrow-derived pluripotent mesenchymal stem-like cells [ 25 ]. In prostate cancer, the androgen-dependent up-regulation of FSTL1 promotes growth of cancer cells [ 26 ]. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FSTL1 is selectively expressed in cancer stroma and attenuates CRC cell proliferation [ 27 ]. Although FSTL1 is overexpressed in plasma and cancerous tissues of CRC patients, it has not been, thus far, implicated in prognosis [ 28 ]. In ovarian and endometrial cancers, FSTL1 functions as a tumor suppressor via inducing apoptosis [ 29 ]. However, the role of FSTL1 in RCC remains elusive.
