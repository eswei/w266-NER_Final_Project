 Recent studies have revealed that lncRNAs act as ceRNAs and interact with miRNAs. LncRNA H19 promotes cell proliferation by sponging miR-200a, thereby increasing Î²-catenin expression in CRC. 19 LncRNA FTX markedly promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by sponging miR-215. 20 Several studies have reported that miR-206 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression was downregulated in various human malignancies. 21 , 22 In CRC, miRNA-206 levels were significantly downregulated in CRC tissues, 23 , 24 and miR-206 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. 24 The expression profile and function of miR-206 in CRC is opposite to that of LINC00707. So we predicted that LINC00707 may function as ceRNA of miR-206. Here, our study revealed that miR-206 is a target of LINC00707. Changes in LINC00707 expression led to corresponding changes in the expression levels of miR-206, suggestive of the negative regulation of miR-206 expression by LINC00707. Therefore, the effects of LINC00707 on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion may be explained, at least in part, by its role as a molecular sponge of miR-206.
