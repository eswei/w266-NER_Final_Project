 In our work, we observed that miR-940 was highly expressed in EC, and connected with poor prognosis of this cancer. To explore the roles of miR-940 in EC, miR-940 mimics or inhibitors were employed to increase or reduce miR-940 expression in RL95-2 cells. The results demonstrated that the transfection of miR-940 mimics significantly increased the proliferation and migration/invasion of RL95-2 cells, and the RL95-2 cell growth and migration/invasion in the miR-940 inhibitor group were inhibited, implicating that miR-940 might play an oncogene role in EC. Consistently, Fan et al. [ 27 ] have suggested that miR-940 induces the cell proliferation and migration of gastric cancer through up-regulating the expression level of programmed death ligand-1. Moreover, Liu et al. [ 18 ] have reported that miR-940 enhances the cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer via mediating the expression level of ZNF24. Another study has also demonstrated that high expression of miR-940 promotes proliferation of pancreatic cancer through regulating GSK3Î² and sFRP1 [ 28 ]. On the contrary, opposite findings were obtained. For example, Rajendiran et al. [ 20 ] have revealed that miR-940 attenuates growth ability, and suppresses the migratory and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells by regulating MIEN1. Ding et al. [ 29 ] have implied that miR-940 blocks cell migration and invasion via regulating CXCR2 in liver cancer. MiR-940 has also been demonstrated to inhibit pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma growth through targeting MyD88 [ 30 ]. These discrepancies may indicate that miR-940 acts as different roles among diverse human cancers, partially through regulating different targets, to a certain degree.
