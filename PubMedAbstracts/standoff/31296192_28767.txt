 We further included serum folate in the model to assess whether the associations between inflammation markers and MCI were mediated by serum folate level. Considering the MCI could be directly linked to the inflammation markers or the serum folate might have an indirect effect on MCI through improving the inflammation markers, we evaluated the associations of inflammation markers and MCI after further adjusting for serum folate. In the present study, there was a significant positive association of serum hs-CRP and MCI after adjusted for common diabetes related factors and cardiovascular diseases risk factors among T2D patients in the low folate subgroup (< 7.0 μg/L). Our results have indicated that there might be somewhat relationship among peripheral folate, inflammatory cytokines and cognition status [ 37 ]. It has been reported that folate deficiency might enhance the expression of the inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, independent of the concentration of homocysteine [ 38 ]. On the contrary, folic acid may inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced production of IL-1β and TNF-α through inhibiting the MAPKs and NF-κB pathways [ 39 ]. A recent animal study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of folic acid in prevention of apoptosis by inhibiting TNF-α action in ischemia-reperfusion induced liver injury has also shown that folic acid might inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting the action of TNF-α [ 40 ]. Moreover, folic acid supplement to the patients with MCI could significantly reduce peripheral TNF-α and IL-6 levels [ 41 ]. These data indicated that optimal serum folate status might influence the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α among T2D patients with MCI. Thus, more randomized controlled trials will be performed to explore whether serum folate might have an indirect effect on MCI through improving the inflammation reactions among T2D patients.
