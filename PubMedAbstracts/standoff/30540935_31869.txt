 Furthering this hypothesis required showing that the profound effect of KLF4 on malignancy, presumably mediated through a network of specific, KLF4-regulated genes, has its counterpart in human cancer, and specifically in prostate cancer. Evidence showing that KLF4 expression is diminished in human prostate cancer metastasis ( Liu et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2010 ) supports this notion. An RNA-seq analysis we performed revealed that knocking down KLF4 induced genes that are part of the tumor metastasis pathways, stem cell pluripotency markers, and, in confirmation of our experimental results, EMT (Figure 3E). Further analysis revealed a substantial overlap between the KLF4-regulated genes in our murine model and those genes that characterize malignancy in cohorts of human prostate cancer (Figures 5G and 5H). Moreover, we show that Klf4 regulates several pathways that are important for tumor progression, including Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnt/Ca⁺, and PPAR pathways (Figure 5D). The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a crucial role in the development and progression of prostate cancer to more aggressive and even therapy-resistant disease states, and the inhibition of Hh signaling has the potential to reduce prostate cancer invasiveness and metastatic potential ( Gonnissen et al., 2013 ). Similarly, Wnt/Ca⁺ activity, regulated by Klf4 in our model, is increased in prostate cancer cells ( Wang et al., 2010 ), and PPAR activation has been shown to promote prostate cancer cell growth ( Forootan et al., 2016 ). We found a substantial overlap between genes linked to the invasive sarcomatoid tumors induced by Klf4 knockdown (Figures 5G and 5H) and those genes that define metastatic and aggressive human prostate cancer ( Chandran et al., 2007 ; Mortensen et al., 2015 ), opening a path to identifying new targets for therapy of aggressive cancers and giving support to the relevance of this model to prostate cancer.
