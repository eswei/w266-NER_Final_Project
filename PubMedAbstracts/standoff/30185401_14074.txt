 To date, serum vitamin B12 levels have been reported to be normal in cases of TC deficiency [ 4 , 10 , 16 ]. This is due to the fact that the majority of vitamin B12 in circulation is bound to haptocorrin rather than transcobalamin. As a result, patients with TC deficiency do not show a low level of circulating vitamin B12 [ 1 , 2 ]. However, Schiff et al. [ 8 ] reported TC-deficient patients with low vitamin B12 levels. In the present study, Case 4 had the unusual feature of a low serum cobalamin level, similar to the cases reported in Schiff et al.â€™s [ 8 ] study. Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are the metabolic markers of vitamin B12 deficiency [ 7 ]. The diagnosis of TC deficiency is confirmed by the measurement of these metabolic markers, although they can rarely be within normal limits [ 10 ]. Consistent with these data, the homocysteine levels of Case 3 were in the upper limit of normal. Therefore, our findings indicate that a normal or low serum vitamin B12 level or a slightly elevated homocysteine level does not exclude TC deficiency. Thus, molecular analysis should be done in order to establish a firm diagnosis in subjects with suggested TC deficiency but with normal plasma homocysteine levels.
