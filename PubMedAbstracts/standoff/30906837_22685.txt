 Recent researches found serum Hcy levels may be associated with NAFLD susceptibility. 12 , 13 MTHFR 677CT and 677TT can lower the activity of the MTHFR, resulting in elevated Hcy levels. ⁹ In this study, we had also analyzed relationship between serum Hcy levels as well as MTHFR 677CT gene polymorphism with NAFLD. However, serum Hcy levels were significantly higher among NAFLD subjects (Table 2), But further analysis found that MTHFR 677CT polymorphism and serum Hcy level had no interaction effect on NAFLD (Table 3). Up to now, the relationship between serum Hcy levels and the susceptibility of NAFLD is inconclusive. One study shows higher Hcy levels existed in NAFLD patients and were correlated with the severity of insulin resistance, ¹² the mechanisms may be relevant to alter intracellular lipid metabolism and promote hepatic fat accumulation in subjects with HHcy. ³¹ But another study showed after adjustment for risk factors of NAFLD such as BMI, WC, gender, age, and log (HOMA-IR), there was no relationship between HHcy and the NAFLD susceptibility. ¹³ Therefore, the interaction effect of MTHFR 677CT polymorphism and serum Hcy level on NAFLD also need to be confirmed by animal experiments.
