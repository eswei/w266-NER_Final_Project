 Lung cancer prognosis assessment is widely based on the TNM staging system, but clinical outcomes indicate that early stage lung cancer patients receiving surgical management are still at high risk of recurrence.5 While analyzing AJCC T1N0M0 stage patients, we observed that the upregulation of UCK2 resulted in poorer OS and DFS, indicating the significant role of UCK2 in the prognosis of lung cancer patients, which was confirmed by microarray assay. Moreover, the elevated expression of UCK2 was closely related with higher T stage and N stage and a higher likelihood of relapse of lung cancer, which implied that UCK2 has significant potential for prognosis monitoring. In addition, Zhou et al26 found that UCK2 could promote metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, speculating the implication of UCK2 in lung cancer metastasis. GEO31210 analysis showed a higher UCK2 expression level in EGFR‐nonmutated group compared to the EGFR‐mutated group. Lung ADC with EGFR‐activating mutations responded well to gefitinib.29 UCK2 could act as a candidate drug target site in EGFR‐nonmutated lung cancer patients. Long‐term smoking contributes to approximately 85% of lung cancer30; approximately 10%‐15% of cases are found in non‐smokers.31 Patients with smoking history had higher UCK2 expression than those with no smoking history, revealed by analysis of GEO41271, thus predicting that smoking could facilitate the expression of UCK2. Further analysis of the effect of high expression of UCK2 on smoking in lung ADC and lung SCC showed that high UCK2 expression was closely related to smoking in ADC patients but not SCC patients.
