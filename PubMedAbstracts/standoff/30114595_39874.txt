 Whole Exome Sequencing Data Analysis Mutations that were previously reported in developing metastatic colorectal cancer were screened. The proposed functions of mutations and references are listed in Supplementary Table 9 [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] . CTNNB1 codes β-catenin, which plays a major role in Wnt signaling, and its status is closely related to distant metastasis. SNU-2335A harbored c.1974C>A/p.Asp658Glu missense mutation in CTNNB1, which was not detected in its paired metastatic cell lines. The c.1974C>A/p.Asp658Glu missense mutation was reported previously, but its functional role has not been discovered. Although all cell lines had MSH3 missense mutations, cells were identified as microsatellite stable. According to dbSNP database, clinical significance of one mutation (c.235A>G/p.Ile79Val) was known to be benign, and that of other two mutations (c.2846A>G/p.Gln949Arg and c.3133G>A/p.Ala1045Thr) was unknown. Even though c.3133G>A/p.Ala1045Thr mutation was reported to increase cancer risk in multiple organs such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and esophageal cancer [33] , none was reported to be related with inactivation of MSH3. One missense mutation in the CYP2A7 was shared in all three peritoneal metastatic cell lines. CYP2A7 is expressed mainly in liver tissue, and its role in colorectal cancer remains unclear. We took advantage of publically available cancer cell line database (canSAR) and drew comparison between mutational status of CYP2A7 gene and CNN3 expression level. Although the genomic positions of mutation were various, missense mutations of CYP2A7 were found in SNU-1040 (c.306C>T/p.Gly102Gly), SNU-C5 (c.164A>T/p.Tyr55Phe), and HCT-15 (c.230G>A/p.Arg77Gln) cell lines among 14 available CRC cell lines from the canSAR database. These cell lines had relatively high CNN3 level compared to the rest of 11 cell lines analyzed (Figure 2A). This may imply that mutational status of CYP2A7 gene is connected to augmented CNN3 expression. We also compared our WES data to findings by Nicholas E. Navin’s lab which reported genomic alterations in distant metastases in a single cell level [34] . They detected 13 mutations that were exclusively found in primary CRC and 37 mutations that were selectively harbored in metastatic cells by deep-exome sequencing. Although genomic positions of each mutation varied, 5 genes were found to have missense mutations in our primary CRC cell lines, and 9 genes were found to have missense mutations in our peritoneal metastasis cell lines (Supplementary Table 10-15). They also reported genes that mediated clonal evolution in the metastatic site by ultra-deep targeted sequencing. We screened the variant allele frequency of those genes in our primary CRC and peritoneal metastasis cell lines (Supplementary Tables 16-18). In SNU-2414 set, PIK3CG and LINGO2 mutations were detected in primary CRC, and SPEN mutation was found in metastasis cell line, which was concordant with their findings. Moreover, variant allele frequencies of three missense mutations in EYS gene (c.5705A>T, c.4256T>C, c.1712A>G) were changed from ~0.5 in SNU-2414A to 1 in SNU-2414B, which may indicate clonal evolution at metastatic site. The potential role of EYS gene in metastasis should be elucidated.
