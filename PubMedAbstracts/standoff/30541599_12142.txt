 Results We investigated expression levels of several different genes and gene families that are purported to impact CP structural integrity and CSF production. The SLC family of genes, for example, appears responsible for considerable ion and H₂O transport across CPE [ 25 ]. Within the SLC group, there was diversified expression in control versus AD. Certain genes for HCO₃− exchange and co-transport (SLC4 subfamily) had decreased expression in AD, including SLC4A10 (p = 0.028, log2FC = 0.039) and SLC4A5 (p = 0.004, log2FC = 1.12). Other SLC genes with decreased expression include the Na–K–Cl co-transporters SLC12A1 (p = 0.035, log2FC = 1.05) and SLC12A2 (p = 0.005, log2FC = 0.38). Table 1 compiles downregulated CP genes in the Brown-Merck database relevant to CSF production, energy production and CP structural integrity. Included in each table is the fold-change (log2 FC) in expression between AD and control.
