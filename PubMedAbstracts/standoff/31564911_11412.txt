 MHC class II also expressed on tumor cells. Loss of MHC class II expression on lymphoma cells was associated with poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 20 Expression of HLA-DR on colorectal cancer cells was found to be associated with the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and peritumoral lymphocytes and it might link to a better prognosis in stage C colorectal cancer. 16 Sconocchia et al reported that MHC class II expression on colorectal cancer cells was a favorable prognostic factor, but there were still some discrepancies. 21 MHC class II expression on cervical adenocarcinoma cells was associated with a lower recurrence and a better disease-specific survival in cervical adenocarcinoma patients. 44 Papillary thyroid carcinoma patients with HLA-DR, HLA-DQ expression on cancer cells had a lower rate of lymph nodule metastasis and required a lower dosage of ¹³¹I for treatment than HLA-DQ negative patients. 17 Lazzaro et al found expression of HLA-DR on cancer cells was higher in breast medullary carcinoma compared to breast ductal carcinoma and medullary carcinoma had a relatively better prognosis. 18 Expression level of HLA-DQ on melanoma cells was lower than HLA-DR in primary and metastatic melanoma. 15
