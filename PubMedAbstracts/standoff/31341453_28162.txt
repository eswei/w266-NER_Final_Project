 Despite the fact that both miR-143 and miR-145 are found on the locus of chromosome 5 (q32), there are controversies regarding their expressions and specific functions in cervical carcinogenesis.[ 8 , 48 ] Series of in vitro (involving CaSki and SiHa cells) and in vivo (among individuals diagnosed with cervical cancer) investigations show that miR-143 and miR-145 are underexpressed in HPV16/18/31 positive cells.[ 10 , 49 , 50 ] Interestingly, an array of data also show that HPV- cancer cell line (C-33A) had underexpressed miR-143 and miR-145.[ 32 ] In 2011, Li et al. reported that miR-145 is overexpressed in CIN but underexpressed in cervical cancer.[ 30 ] Subsequently, Wilting et al., following in vitro and in vivo analysis, observed that miR-143 and miR-145 are transiently overexpressed in HPV+ premalignant lesions (1.38 and 1.05 fold changes, respectively). They also observed 1.92 and 0.85 fold changes of miR-143 and miR-145, respectively, in malignant cells when compared with the healthy cervix. The reason for the discordance is yet to be understood.[ 29 ] However, in this study, miR-143 was relatively and progressively upregulated in abnormal cervical cells while the expression varied in serum. The observed variation in miR-143 expression may be influenced by HPV type, hence more studies on this are warranted. Contrastingly, in this study, miR-145, which was relatively downregulated across the classes of cervical abnormalities, is in consonance with the discoveries in some earlier studies.[ 24 , 26 , 28 ]
