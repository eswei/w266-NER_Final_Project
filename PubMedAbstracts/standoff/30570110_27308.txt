 Consistent with the findings of previous studies, PLK4 expression was upregulated in human CRC tissues in the present study. Furthermore, PLK4 promoted the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. PLK4 also affected the expression of several EMT-associated proteins; N-cadherin and snail were upregulated, and occludin was downregulated in cells overexpressing PLK4, thus suggesting a novel mechanism underlying the role of PLK4 in cancer. The present study investigated the function of PLK4 and suggested that it may act as an oncogene in CRC. Previous studies revealed that PLK4 manipulates numerous signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor β and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways. In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a critical mediator of carcinogenic signals in various tumor types ( 17 , 28 - 30 ). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway induces the EMT process and inhibits the transcription of E-cadherin, which is commonly considered an activator of cancer progression ( 31 - 33 ). β-catenin directly influences the biological characteristics of cells, and has been reported to downregulate E-cadherin expression, and to promote EMT-like transition and invasiveness in carcinoma cells ( 34 ). In addition, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to EMT through upregulation of EMT-associated factors, including snail and slug ( 34 - 36 ). In the present study, the expression levels of β-catenin were significantly increased in response to PLK4 overexpression in CRC cells. These findings indicated that PLK4 may mediate EMT in CRC cells via its effects on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, ultimately improving the migratory and invasive potential of the cells.
