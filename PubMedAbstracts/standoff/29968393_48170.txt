 Furthermore, we identified a gene signature of SDC3 downstream and its expressions were significantly related to cancer aggressiveness. Among 26 downstream genes, several genes have already reported roles in RCC pathogenesis. ITGA4 promoted cancer cell metastasis and the kinesin family was related to cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in RCC.36, 37 Interestingly, high expression of 7 genes (SDC3, PLXDC1, IL18RAP, GZMH, ATP8B3, TBX15, and TMC8) significantly predicted poor prognosis of RCC patients according to TCGA datasets. PLXDC1 (also known as TEM7) was initially cloned as a high expression protein from vascular endothelium of human cancer.38 Several studies showed that its expression contributed to angiogenesis.39, 40 In gastric cancer, aberrant expression of PLXDC1 enhanced cancer cell migration and invasive abilities.41 TBX15 is a member of the T‐box family of transcription factors; dysregulated expression of some TBX members is involved in human disease and carcinogenesis.42 In thyroid cancer cells, expression of TBX15 induced Bcl2 and Bcl‐XL (anti‐apoptotic proteins) expression and its overexpression played a role of anti‐apoptosis.43 These studies showed that SDC3 and its regulatory network have potential to be therapeutic targets of RCC. Further analysis of SDC3 could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for RCC.44
