 In our study, 86.9% patients had normal or elevated e-GFR. Out of the total 351 subjects, 62.7% were affected by vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. In two Chinese cross-sectional surveys among diabetic inpatients, the proportions of subjects with 25OHD levels < 25 mmol/L and < 50 nmol/L were 59.7% and 83.5%, respectively [ 34 – 35 ]. These findings demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is quite common among Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, greater prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is observed in women, which is consistent with several epidemiologic surveys [ 36 – 37 ]. It is speculated that more indoor work, less outdoor activities, and less sun exposure among women are possible causes. Further, patients with microalbuminuria had a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency compared to those with normoalbuminuria; in addition, patients with macroalbuminuria had more severe vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Multivariate regression analysis showed that gender, hypertension, increased systolic blood pressure, poor glycemic control, hyperuricemia, and low 25OHD levels were independent risk factors for albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. Of note, type 2 diabetes patients with low vitamin D levels were at a 62% higher risk of albuminuria as compared to vitamin D sufficient patients. Adjustment for potential confounders did not attenuate this association, which suggests that low vitamin D level may be a risk factor for albuminuria, an established and modifiable risk factor for kidney disease in the general population. These findings are consistent with those of a previous Chinese cross-sectional survey that showed a close relationship between the serum 25OHD levels and UACR level in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 35 ].
