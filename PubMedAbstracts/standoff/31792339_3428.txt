 Recepteur d’Origine Nantais (RON), also known as the macrophage stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R), is mainly expressed in macrophages, osteoclasts, hematopoietic and epithelial cells ¹⁶ – ¹⁹ . As one member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, RON is involved in a series of biological functions such as immune response and wound healing ²⁰ , ²¹ . Aberrant expression of RON is associated with tumor stage, poor prognosis and invasiveness in many cancer types ²² . It is known that RON functions as a mediator of tumor progression in some cancers ²³ , ²⁴ . Once activated by its ligand, macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), RON promotes the invasive growth of cancer cells mainly through activation of several signaling pathways such as β-catenin, PLCγ, PI3K/AKT and MAPK etc. ²⁵ – ²⁷ . RON also plays a role in immunosuppression by regulating the properties of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment ²⁸ . RON is highly expressed by osteoclasts and has been shown to participate in bone metastasis through mediating dysregulated bone absorption ²⁹ . It is also known that the functions of RON in cells can be independent of MSP ³⁰ . In lung cancer, recent studies indicate that RON may be a potent biomarker of tumor progression, metastasis and prognosis ³¹ . To date, however, the potential biological roles of RON in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC and downstream pathways have not been fully elucidated.
