 CPC contains Survivin, Borealin, Aurora-B and INCENP, and acts as a critical mitotic regulator that controls the cell cycle and serves a crucial role in the expansion of tumor cells ( 13 , 14 ). In the present study, the expression of USP22 was identified to be positively associated with Aurora-B and Survivin in OSCC. In addition, high USP22, Aurora-B, or Survivin expression is associated with a poor prognosis in OSCC, especially when all are highly expressed concomitantly. Survivin inhibits apoptosis, regulates chromosome separation and cell division ( 13 – 15 ), and is highly expressed in various types of cancer, which typically have a poor prognosis, including colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, endometrial carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma ( 7 , 21 – 26 ). Aurora-B regulates cytokinesis and chromosome segregation together with Survivin, Borealin and INCENP ( 7 , 8 , 23 , 24 ). Aurora B is highly expressed in a number of types of cancer, including head and neck, colon, liver and breast cancer, and is associated with malignancy indicators, including the histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis ( 23 – 26 ). USP22, Aurora-B and Survivin are highly expressed in OSCC, and serve an important role in the tumorigenesis of oral cancer most likely by disrupting cell cycle progression ( 23 , 26 , 27 ). USP22, Aurora-B and Survivin expression may be promising markers for predicting the malignant behaviors of OSCC. These observations are supported by previous data suggesting that high levels of Survivin and Aurora-B were associated with more malignant phenotypes and that they were independent prognostic indicators for multifarious cancers ( 9 , 22 – 26 ).
