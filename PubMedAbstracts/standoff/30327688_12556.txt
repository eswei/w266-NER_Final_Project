 NGAL is considered to be another sensitive and early biomarker of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. It is a small (25 kD) protein, locally synthesized in renal tubular epithelial cells [ 10 ] and released into urine. Initially, NGAL was thought to be a biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI) [ 11 ] but recent studies demonstrated its increased urinary excretion also in patients with various chronic nephropathies. Furthermore, correlation between urinary NGAL excretion and severity of local inflammation and kidney function was observed [ 12 – 15 ]. NGAL may also be released into the circulation from damaged renal tubular epithelial cells. Its elevated serum level is suggested to be a risk factor for CKD progression [ 16 – 19 ]. In our study, it was also showed that urinary NGAL excretion may be a potential biomarker of ON in patients with HN due to UPJO [ 18 – 22 ]. We found that urinary NGAL excretion was significantly higher in patients with HN and ON as compared to patients with HN and without ON. In our study, urinary NGAL excretion positively correlated with a deterioration of relative function of an obstructed kidney in dynamic renal scintigraphy. Moreover, similar to the urinary alpha-GST/Cr ratio, the ROC curve analysis showed a very good diagnostic profile for the urinary NGAL/Cr ratio in the detection of ON. Interestingly, Gerber et al. [ 23 ] did not find significant differences in urinary NGAL excretion between patients with UPJO and controls. Nevertheless, their results might be influenced by relatively small number of cases.
