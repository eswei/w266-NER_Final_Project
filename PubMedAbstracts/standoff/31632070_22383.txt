 Numerous studies have shown that ncRNAs are closely related to the regulation of various pathophysiological processes in tumors. 20 In the present study, circZNF609 was differentially expressed in GC tissues and paracancerous tissues. Its expression level was closely related to the clinical TNM stage and prognosis of GC patients, suggesting the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of circZNF609 in GC. Hence, circZNF609 is expected to be a novel hallmark for tumor diagnosis and evaluation. In vitro assay demonstrated the high expression of circZNF609 in GC, which was able to promote proliferative and migratory capacities of GC cells. Besides, numerous miRNAs are involved in tumor development by regulating cell proliferation and migration. 21 , 22 For example, miR-647 is lowly expressed in GC. Overexpression of miR-647 promotes proliferation and migration of tumor cells by regulating expression levels of ANK2, FAK, MMP2, MMP12 and CD44. 23 Previous studies have shown that miR-483-3p inhibits the progression of breast cancer by inhibiting CCNE1 expression. 15 miR-483-3p reverses EMT and inhibits gefitinib resistance by directly targeting on integrin Î²3 through inhibiting downstream FAK/ERK pathway. 24 In the present study, circZNF609 was confirmed for its sponge of miR-483-3p through dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RIP assay. Overexpression of miR-483-3p could reverse the promoted cell proliferation and migration induced by the overexpressed circZNF609, suggesting that the regulatory effect of circZNF609 on GC cells was mainly through absorbing miR-483-3p.
