 Malignant cancer cells are characterized by increased glucose uptake, with high fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by the tumor indicative of a poor prognosis in patients with head and neck cancers and laryngeal carcinoma. 1 , 8 GLUT-1 modulates the cellular influx of glucose 9 and is the main glucose transporter in several types of solid carcinomas. It has thus become a frequent focus of cancer research. 10 Cancer cells are under hypoxic stress, which causes them to mobilize glucose uptake to provide energy for cell proliferation. 11 GLUT-1 therefore serves as an intrinsic marker of hypoxia in cancer cells. 12 HIF-1α, as a hypoxia response gene, promotes GLUT-1 expression 12 , 13 via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, as also demonstrated during FDG uptake. 14 In most types of cancers, GLUT-1 and HIF-1α cooperate to accelerate cancer development, resulting in a poor outcome for patients. 15 – 20 The HIF-1α-induced upregulation of GLUT-1 is significantly associated with cancer recurrence and metastasis in patients with laryngeal carcinoma. This observation suggests the use of HIF-1α/GLUT-1 as a gene signature for the diagnosis and prediction of laryngeal carcinoma 1 and also as a potential therapeutic target for laryngeal carcinoma.
