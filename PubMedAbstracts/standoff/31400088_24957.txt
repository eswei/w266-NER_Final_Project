 The potential neuroprotection from haemin treatment within the activated miR‐21‐5p‐DUSP8‐ERK1/2 signalling pathway after haemorrhagic damage is noteworthy. In contrast, with haemin treatment, miR‐21‐5p was knocked down by injecting A‐miR‐21‐5p into the lateral ventricles of rats before collagenase injection. A‐miR‐21‐5p effectively alleviated ICH‐induced injury in vivo. Both A‐miR‐21‐5p and haemin decreased brain haematoma volume and profoundly reduced neuronal death. In addition, A‐miR‐21‐5p preserved more BBB integrity than did haemin and reduced cerebral oedema after inducing ICH. Both A‐miR‐21‐5p and haemin therapy alleviated tissue iron deposition and accelerated haematoma absorption 10 days post‐ICH. Similarly, A‐miR‐21‐5p injection induced better neurological scores and motor coordination after ICH was induced in aged rats. Moreover, A‐miR‐21‐5p affected post‐ICH behavioural changes by greatly improving cognition, poststroke anxiety and memory deficit with aging. Consequently, both treatments contributed to protection from haemorrhagic damage and neurological deficits. In the water maze experiment, cognition and learning‐memory disorders were effectively reversed after haemin treatment, but the motor functions of the haemin group, such as movement velocity and distance, did not significantly improve. Surviving neurons likely caused unregulated haemoglobin synthesis in response to ICH‐associated stress, thus increasing the α‐globin levels in the diseased tissue. Ferritin upregulation in ICH‐senescent brains has been found to increase iron availability in the absence of globin‐chain upregulation and improve cognitive functions in aging (Huang Z et al., 2013).
