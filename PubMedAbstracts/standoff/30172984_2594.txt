 Elevated plasma hcy, or hyperhomocysteinemia (hhcy), is categorized by range as moderate (15–30 μM), intermediate (30–100 μM), and severe (above 100 μM). The most common form of severe hhcy is that by CBS deficiency. Patients with CBS deficiency suffer from numerous clinical complications including not only vascular disease, ectopia lentis, osteoporosis, fatty liver but also cognitive dysfunctions such as intellectual disabilities, seizures and psychiatric disorders including personality disorder, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and psychotic episodes [1] , [2] . Hhcy is also a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), even if hhcy is moderate [3] . Moreover, elevated hcy level has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and autism [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] . We showed that hhcys is accompanied by alterations in signaling pathways initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), the ERK and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB signaling pathway, in brain of CBS deficient mice, a murine model of hhcy [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] .
