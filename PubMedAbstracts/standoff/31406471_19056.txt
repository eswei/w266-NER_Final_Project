 Clinical studies have reported elevated MMP13 expression in patients with articular cartilage destruction, 37 , 38 indicating that raised MMP13 levels may contribute to cartilage degradation. A previous study showed that transgenic mice overexpressing Mmp13 exhibit OA phenotype, including cartilage degradation. TLR4 signaling is associated with catabolic response via MMP13. 39 TLR4 ligands stimulate MMP13 in human chondrocytes 40 , 41 and synovial fibroblasts. 42 Here, MMP13 expression was increased in the SYN of KOA patients with high HbA1c concentrations. In addition, the TLR4 agonist, LPS, stimulated MMP13 expression and MMP13 production. Several endogenous TLR4 ligands that may exacerbate diabetic conditions have been reported, including advanced glycation end products, 41 macroglobulin 43 and amyloid-β. 44 However, it is unclear which endogenous ligands contribute to the elevation of MMP13 in KOA patients with high HbA1c concentrations. Nevertheless, elevation of TLR4 and MMP13 expression in the SYN of KOA patients with high HbA1c concentrations may explain some of the epidemiological findings showing that DM is associated with OA. Previous epidemiological studies have reported that DM patients have high prevalence of overweight/obesity. 45 – 47 Fatani et al reported that 41% of a DM patient population was obese. 46 Hedley et al reported that 70% of DM patients were obese. 47 In our study, patients with HbA1c ≥6.5 had higher BMI than those with HbA1c <6.5, and 56% of OA patients with HbA1c ≥6.5 were obese. However, TLR4 and MMP13 expression were comparable among normal, overweight, and obese patients. Therefore, our results suggest that higher TLR4 and MMP13 expression may be reflective of diabetic conditions but not obesity.
