 miR-944 plays tumor-suppressive or tumor-promoting activities during carcinogenesis and cancer progression. For example, miR-944 upregulation inhibits the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells by regulating the MACC1/Met/AKT signaling pathway. 18 miR-944 directly targets EPHA7 to suppress cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer. 19 In contrast, the resumption of miR-944 expression increases cell growth and metastasis and improves the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in breast cancer by regulating the BNIP3-MMP-caspase-3 pathway. 22 miR-944 also acts as an oncogenic miRNA in endometrial 20 and cervical 21 cancers. A previous study also reported that miR-944 knockdown restrained the proliferation of Hep3B cells. 36 However, the specific roles of miR-944 in HCC are not well established. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-944 overexpression attenuated HCC cell proliferation, clone formation, metastasis, and EMT and increased apoptosis, whereas miR-944 silencing led to the opposite results. Additionally, ectopic miR-944 expression hindered HCC tumor growth in vivo. These findings support the notion that miR-944 may be an attractive target when treating patients with this deadly disease.
