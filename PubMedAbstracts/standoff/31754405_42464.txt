 Current studies indicate that CD44 is an important marker for CSCs that contributes to the activation of stem cell regulatory genes and supports the maintenance of CSCs 30 - 32 . Ample evidence indicates that CSCs are enriched or activated during cancer therapies, and CD44 contributes to the drug resistance of CSCs 30 , 47 , 48 . For instance, CD44ʰⁱᵍʰ breast cancer cells that survive epirubicin treatment exhibit the growth and gene expression signatures of CSCs 49 . In the present study, we identified CD44 as a direct and functional target of miR-302a in the regulation of CTX resistance in CRC. We found that CD44 silencing sensitized CRC cells to CTX treatment, while CD44 overexpression induced CTX resistance, but this effect could be abrogated by the ectopic expression of miR-302a. We also found that CD44 was upregulated in stem cell-enriched tumor spheres, and miR-302a overexpression or CD44 silencing showed consistent inhibitory effects on tumor sphere growth and the expression of stem cell markers. In addition, we observed a negative correlation between miR-302a and CD44 in CRC tissues. These results suggest that miR-302a regulates the CTX resistance of CRC cells possibly though the suppression of CD44 and its effects on CSCs.
