 Inflammatory processes play a critical role in HCC development ²³ , ²⁴ . TNF has been established as a key promoter of inflammation-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in NAFLD, alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic viral hepatitis ²⁵ – ²⁷ . Although liver inflammation has been shown to drive hepatocarcinogenesis via TNF in DEN-induced and CCl₄-induced murine models of hepatitis, TNF’s downstream target(s) that promote tumorigenic change in hepatocytes remain largely unknown. However, it is known that TNF-driven liver inflammation is associated with dysregulated expression of GPCR-associated proteins. Here, we initially observed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (most notably TNF), infiltration of inflammatory cells, and upregulation of four GPCR-associated genes (CCR10, P2RY8, ARRB1, and RGS10) in human HCC tumor and paracancerous specimens. Notably, all four GPCR-associated genes have been previously associated with human carcinogenesis, ²⁸ – ³⁰ . Through RT-PCR and Western blotting validation, we confirmed that CCR10 expression was significantly elevated in hepatocytes isolated from matching human HCC tumor and paracancerous specimens. Moreover, FACS revealed strong CCR10 expression in paracancerous and HCC hepatocytes with negligible CCR10 expression in normal hepatocytes.
