 In this study, we revealed that the ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 minor allele (T) is associated with high AF occurrence but low recurrence after AF ablation. The ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 was linked to AF onset by a GWAS, but the precise mechanism of association with AF pathogenesis has not been elucidated. Similarly, the mechanisms underlying this discrepancy between onset risk and recurrence risk remain to be revealed. The minor allele of ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 was also associated with high BMI [ 19 ], but in our study BMI was similar among ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 genotypes. ZFHX3 knockdown in atrial myocytes was reported to dysregulate calcium homeostasis and increase atrial arrhythmogenesis, ultimately contributing to AF occurrence [ 20 ]. Huang et al. reported that interaction between ZFHX3 SNP and PITX2 SNP. They also reported that ZFHX3 positively regulated PITX2c expression [ 21 ]. The PITX2 regulates process that pulmonary mesenchyme differentiates in myocardium, initiates a phase of rapid proliferation and expands to form the myocardial sheet around the pulmonary vein branches. Overexpression of PITX2 may promote the proliferation of myocardial sleeve around the pulmonary vein branches and increase automaticity from there [ 22 ]. ZFHX3 SNP rs2106261 may modulate PITX2c expression levels and associate with high occurrence of AF. We performed PV isolation and paroxysmal AF patients with ZFHX3 SNP minor allele have lower AF recurrence rate than those without. Given that ZFHX3 SNP acts through PITX2c expression levels, AF trigger in paroxysmal AF patients with ZFHX3 SNP minor allele was related to PV and they easily cured by PVI.
