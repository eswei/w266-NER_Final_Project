 IL-6 is mainly secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate an immune response and cause inflammation. IL-6 is critical for tumor microenvironment regulation and may be a key regulator during colorectal tumorigenesis via regulation of tumor-promoting inflammation [ 16 – 18 ]. Patients with advanced/metastatic cancer had high IL-6 [ 19 , 20 ], and IL-6 expression was significantly elevated in CRC tissues compared to noncancerous tissues and was associated with invasiveness and lymph node metastasis [ 21 ]. Anti-IL-6 therapy was initially developed for treating autoimmune diseases, but the role of IL-6 in chronic inflammation suggests that IL-6 blockade may be feasible for cancer treatment [ 22 , 23 ]. TNF-α is a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation produced chiefly by activated macrophages. TNF-α plays a pivotal role in malignant cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and metastasis in CRC [ 24 ]. A previous study demonstrated that serum TNF-α may contribute to CRC susceptibility, and anti-TNF therapy was considered for CRC treatment [ 25 ]. In this study, matrine reduced elevated IL-6 and TNF-α in CRC, which was consistent with previous studies. TGF-β1 is a protein secreted by most immune cells, and it contributes to immune system control and performs cellular functions, including control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [ 26 ]. A study showed that TGF-β1 promoted CRC immune escape [ 27 ]. TGF-β1 was increased in peripheral blood of CRC patients and may be associated with tumor size and location [ 28 , 29 ]. Matrine did not affect TGF-β1 expression.
