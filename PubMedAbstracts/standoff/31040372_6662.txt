 In the present study, we investigate whether aberrant NO production contributes to the formation of precancerous breast lesions from normal mammary epithelia using cell lines of a breast cancer progression series as well as animal models. Here, we show that the basal level of NO production in cultured MECs plummets along with cancer progression. This was primarily due to reduction of the NOS cofactor, BH₄, under increased oxidative stress (NOS uncoupling), but was independent of NOS levels. Importantly, pharmacological deprivation of NO in developing mouse mammary glands led to the formation of multiple (peripheral) papillomas (precancerous mammary lesions) ⁵⁴ – ⁵⁸ and desmoplastic ECM in all the animals tested. NO-deprived mammary glands exhibited overactivation of an oncogene, ERBB2, and a fibrogenic cytokine, TGFβ. These glands also highly expressed senescence markers, reported to be prevalent in precancerous lesions ⁵⁹ – ⁶¹ . In addition, NO-deprived mammary glands displayed bi-lineage phenotype and stem cell-like properties, which are also reported to be prevalent in precancerous lesions ⁶² – ⁶⁴ . Consistently, application of the BH₄ precursor (sepiapterin) or a NO donor (SNAP or GSNO) to precancerous and cancerous breast cells normalized NO levels, suppressed TGFβ and ERBB2 signals and ameliorated proliferative phenotype. Our results unravel the critical contribution of deficient basal NO production to the pathogenesis of precancerous breast lesions.
