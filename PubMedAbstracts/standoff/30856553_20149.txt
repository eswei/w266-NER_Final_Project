 The COL6 fragments IC-6 and PRO-C6 have also been evaluated in other diseases. IC-6 has been shown to correlate with muscle mass in young subjects [39] . PRO-C6 has been more extensively studied. From a biomarker perspective serum PRO-C6 has been found associated with chronic and diabetic kidney disease [47] , [48] . Likewise, in type 2 diabetic patients PRO-C6 was found to predict response to a PPAR agonist treatment [49] . PRO-C6 has also shown prognostic value in COPD [42] . Interestingly, a preliminary study has shown that high pre-treatment levels of PRO-C6 predicts outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with chemotherapy [50] . These findings indicate that PRO-C6 could be prognostic in cancer, which is also supported by the borderline significant association between cancer stage and PRO-C6 levels (P = .072, when comparing early vs late stage patients). As mentioned, PRO-C6 targets the signaling molecule endothrophin. The protease(s) responsible for generating endothrophin is currently unknown, although in one study incorrectly folded type VI collagen was found in MMP-11 deficient mice [51] . Thus, studies are warranted to evaluate PRO-C6/endothrophin in the oncology setting.
