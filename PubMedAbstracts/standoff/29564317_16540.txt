 Since its discovery, some association has been established between visfatin and PCOS but with conflicting results [ 4 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ]. A number of studies have reported that women with PCOS have higher visfatin levels than those in BMI-matched [ 17 21 34 35 ] or unmatched controls [ 18 36 37 38 ]. Moreover, visfatin levels in normal-weight PCOS patients has been found to be higher than those in obese controls [ 19 ]. On the other hand, serum visfatin levels have been reported to be similar between women with PCOS and BMI-matched [ 27 ] or unmatched controls [ 24 25 26 28 ]. Farshchian et al. [ 27 ] reported that serum visfatin levels were higher in obese women compared to those in normal-weight subjects, but there were no differences in serum visfatin levels between PCOS patients and the controls. Thus, to minimize the effect of obesity, the current study analyzed circulating visfatin levels in non-obese patients and BMI-matched controls and found no differences in serum visfatin levels between these groups. Although there is a possibility that the small differences in serum visfatin levels in lean patients and controls may require a larger number of subjects to demonstrate differences, the findings of this study seem to indicate that visfatin levels are not directly related with the pathophysiology of PCOS after controlling for the effect of obesity.
