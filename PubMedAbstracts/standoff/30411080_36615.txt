 The reason that different serologic fibrosis markers exhibit different behaviors in NAA‐ALF is unclear. In our study cohort, the level of correlation between the serum levels of HA, 4COL7S, and WFA⁺‐M2BP was slight to moderate (Supporting Fig. S2). All three markers generally correlated with PT‐INR and several other factors associated with intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis (Table 3). HA is mostly secreted by HSCs and degraded by LSECs, and the process is maintained by competent Kupffer cells.⁽ 46 ⁾ HA is also important for cell proliferation and migration in the steady state.⁽ 19 ⁾ The correlation of HA and ALT in ALF, as shown in Table 3, might imply destruction of the normal liver structure caused by massive necrosis. Basement membranes comprising type IV collagen appear around liver sinusoids after liver insults.⁽ 31 ⁾ The serum level of 4COL7S, which is the amino‐terminal triple‐helix domain of type IV collagen, has demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity for the detection of cirrhosis than type IV collagen itself.⁽ 24 ⁾ In this current study, 4COL7S was most closely associated with the various clinical features of ALF and might imply an unfavorable environment for liver regeneration. WFA⁺‐M2BP, a newly developed biomarker for liver fibrosis,⁽ 47 ⁾ is secreted by HSCs and induces Mac2 expression in Kupffer cells, which in turn activates HSCs during fibrogenesis.⁽ 48 ⁾ WFA⁺‐M2BP levels were prominently elevated in AIH‐related ALF (Table 2). Administration of corticosteroids for hypertransaminasemia might modify prognosis in AIH‐related ALF, making WFA⁺‐M2BP less useful for predicting prognosis than 4COL7S (Fig. 3A).
