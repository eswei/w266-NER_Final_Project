 Studies have been found that, in many other cancers, Nrf2 may be closely linked to chemotherapy resistance, promote tumor growth and lead to poor prognosis, including lung cancer ( 27 ), pancreatic carcinoma ( 23 , 28 ), breast cancer ( 29 , 30 ), head and neck cancer ( 31 ), prostate cancer ( 32 ), ovarian carcinoma ( 33 , 34 ) and cervical cancer ( 35 ). In addition, in hematopoietic malignancies, only few studies have reported on Nrf2 expression in lymphoma cell lines. Zha et al ( 36 ) reported that in the Raji cell line, treatment with disulfiram (DS) and DS/Cu causes excessive production of reactive oxygen species such that Nrf2 expression is inhibited, which subsequently promotes apoptosis in transplanted tumors in nude mice. It has also been indicated that inhibition of Nrf2 expression may promote apoptosis of lymphoma cells. A study by Chen et al ( 37 ) on the relapse of mantle cell lymphoma compared Nrf2 expression between bortezomib-sensitive cell lines (Jeko and SP53) and resistant cell lines (Mino and Rec-1) after bortezomib treatment. The results indicated that Nrf2 expression was upregulated in bortezomib-resistant cell lines, whereas it was decreased or not significantly changed in sensitive cell lines. This suggested that elevated Nrf2 expression may be associated with bortezomib resistance in mantle cell lymphoma. These studies indicated that elevated Keap1 and Nrf2 expression may be associated with chemotherapy resistance and replace of lymphoma, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
