 Aldosterone works by up-regulating store operated Ca²⁺ entry (SOCE) with subsequent increase of cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration ²⁰ , ²¹ , a powerful stimulator of FGF23 transcription ²² . Renal tubular NaCl wasting and subsequent stimulation of aldosterone release possibly account further for the enhanced FGF23 levels in gene targeted mice expressing WNK-resistant SPAK ²⁷ , ²⁸ or OSR1 ²⁹ , ³⁰ . FGF23 serum levels are increased in heart failure ⁹ , ¹⁰ , acute renal failure ¹¹ , chronic kidney disease ⁴ , ¹⁰ , ¹² , diabetic nephropathy ¹³ and hepatic failure ¹⁴ . In each of these disorders, serum aldosterone levels are increased ³¹ – ³⁷ . Thus, secondary hyperaldosteronism may contribute to or even account for the increased serum FGF23 levels in these disorders. Our data strongly suggest that increased FGF23 levels are a consequence of increased aldosterone levels in NCC KO mice. Vitamin D levels are similar in WT and KO mice, hence vitamin D seems not to be an important driver of FGF23 secretion in NCC KO mice. However, we find that PTH is increased in NCC KO mice, as previously reported ¹⁹ . Since PTH ³⁸ – ⁴⁰ also stimulates FGF23 secretion, PTH may contribute to the increase of FGF23 in NCC KO mice.
