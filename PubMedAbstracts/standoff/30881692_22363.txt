 Even though not explicitly stated in this study, an independent relationship was observed between triglyceride level and insulin resistance. A moderate positive correlation was observed between HOMA-IR and triglyceride level in patients with PCOS (p < 0.001, r = 0.445). Triglyceride levels are considered a useful marker in identifying insulin resistance, particularly in patients with metabolic syndrome ¹⁶ . As stated above, insulin resistance, along with its compensatory hyperinsulinemia, contributed to triglyceride dysregulation in hyperandrogenic patients with PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia inhibits microsomal triglyceride protein expression which is crucial in the regulation of apolipoprotein B-100 and VLDL production. It also suppresses the removal of triglyceride-rich protein. Insulin resistant PCOS patients are more prone to dysregulation of lipid metabolism compared to those with normal insulin sensitivity (81% vs. 65%, respectively) ¹⁴ , ¹⁵ . A recently published study revealed a two-way relationship between androgen excess and insulin resistance. FAI as the indicator of hyperandrogenism can serve as an indicator of glucose tolerance, as an increase in FAI is usually followed by increases in blood glucose concentration, insulin level, and glucose resistance ¹⁷ .
