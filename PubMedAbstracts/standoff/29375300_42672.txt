 As expected, KLF5 was verified to be upregulated in GECs in the present research. Recent studies have implied the involvement of KLF5 in the regulation of tumor progression. Meanwhile, increasing evidence has shown that KLF5 plays a pivotal role in endothelial cells. KLF5 has been found highly expressed in bladder carcinoma cells and downregulation of KLF5 restrains bladder carcinoma cell-induced angiogenesis ( Chen et al., 2006 ; Gao et al., 2015 ). Moreover, previous research has proven that KLF5 is upregulated in prostate cancer cells, and knockdown of KLF5 suppresses prostate cancer cell-induced angiogenesis by inhibiting AKT pathways ( Xing et al., 2014 ; Ci et al., 2015 ). Bioinformatics database predicted that KLF5 had a putative binding site of miR-211. Subsequent luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-211 bound to the KLF5 3′-UTR. Collectively, these results indicated that miR-211 inhibited GBM angiogenesis by targeting the 3′-UTR of KLF5. MiR-211 has been proven to affect gene expression and function by targeting the 3′-UTR. For instance, miR-211 exerts inhibitory effected on gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion by downregulating SOX4 mRNA expression ( Wang C.Y. et al., 2015 ). In addition, miR-211 targets KCNMA1 mRNA 3′-UTR to suppress melanoma cell migration and invasion ( Mazar et al., 2010 ). Also, downregulation of miR-211 is involved in aberrant expression of the PRAME protein by targeting the PRAME mRNA 3′-UTR in melanoma cells ( Sakurai et al., 2011 ). In cervical cancer, miR-211 inhibits the invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells by targeting MUC4 3′-UTR ( Xu et al., 2017 ). Consistent with the above results, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-211 suppressed GBM angiogenesis by targeting KLF5 3′-UTR.
