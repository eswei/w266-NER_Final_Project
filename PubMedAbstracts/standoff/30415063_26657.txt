 As we observed altered phenotypes and phagocytic activities in TAM-like MDM, we hypothesized that CCA alters macrophage to be cancer promoting. We showed that cytokine production including IL-6, MCP-2, MCP-3, CXCL-5, GROα, ANG, GRO a/b/g, IL-8, and IL-10 was increased in TAM-like MDM. Elevations of CXCL5, IL-6, and IL-8 and their contributions to dismal prognosis of CCA were reported [15] , [17] , [44] . IL-6 and GROα from CCA-stimulated mesenchymal cells promoted CCA growth [45] , and IL-10 from CCA promoting CCA progression were shown [46] . The induction of MCP-2 in M-CSF–induced MDM has been reported [47] , and we showed higher MCP-2 in TAM-like MDM. ANG promoted prostate cancer growth, and angiogenesis was noted [48] . Taken together, our results suggested that macrophage exposed to CCA-CM or TAM-like MDM might be an alternative source of cytokines that could promote CCA. The effects of MCP-2, MCP-3, and ANG have never been clarified in CCA and require attention.
