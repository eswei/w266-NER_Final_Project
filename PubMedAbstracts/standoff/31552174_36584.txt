 Chemoresistance is a considerable problem in cancer therapeutic strategy and it remains one of the key factors in cancer death. The majority of tumors show good response to chemotherapy initially; but after continued treatment they start to develop resistance ( 51 , 52 ). In this study, we explored whether miR-375 enhances the chemosensitivity of 5-fluorouracil in CC. Previous studies have demonstrated that miR-375 is involved in the development of chemoresistance in cancers. Shen et al. ( 53 ) found that paclitaxel treated cervical cells and tissues showed high expression of miR-375. Overexpression of miR-375 in CC cells decreased the sensitivity toward paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo. Paclitaxel upregulated miR-375 expression and overexpression of miR-375 increased chemoresistance in CC ( 53 ). Wang et al. ( 43 ) showed that miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance by targeting SEC23A and YAP1 in prostate cancer. miR-375 overexpression significantly reduced prostate cancer cell sensitivity to docetaxel treatment ( 54 ). In contrast, miR-375 enhanced the chemosensitivity to platinum-based cisplatin. Overexpression of miR-375 targets ERBB2 and enhances cisplatin sensitivity in human gastric cells ( 55 ). miR-375 and doxorubicin co-delivered using liposomes increased the sensitivity of doxorubicin by decreasing the expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) by targeting AEG-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma ( 56 ). Our results also show that the ectopic expression of miR-375 enhances 5-fluorouracil chemosensitivity in CC cells by targeting AEG-1. Further studies are required to explore the crosstalk between miR-375 and chemotherapeutic drugs to find out the exact molecular mechanisms involved in CC chemoresistance.
