 The expression of HAI-1, which has an important role in ECM degradation in endometrial cancer, was obviously lower than that in normal endometrium specimens. Increased expression levels of the HAI-1 gene accompanied with decreased expression of matriptase inhibits endometrial cancer cell proliferation and invasive migration [ 19 ]. Some scholars have suggested that maintaining matriptase/HAI-1 equilibrium is crucial in the process of tumor progression. According to previous reports, matriptase/HAI-1 ratio imbalance, which includes increased expression of matriptase or decreased expression of HAI-1, may promote tumor development. In pancreatic cancer cells, increased matriptase/HAI-1 ratio by decreased HAI-1 expression levels promoted tumor invasion [ 29 ]. Similarly, increased matriptase/HAI-1 ratio with increased matriptase expression made prostate cancer more aggressive [ 14 , 25 ]. The matriptase/HAI-1 ratio declined in advanced colorectal cancer and infiltrating breast cancer, while it increased in invasive breast cancer [ 30 , 31 ]. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the regulation of the matriptase/HAI-1 ratio by specific (i.e., siRNA) and non-specific (i.e., cisplatin) targeting associated with decreasing matriptase expression in endometrial cancer cells. In our previous study, we concluded that the expression of matriptase is directly and positively correlated with ovarian cellular invasion and metastasis [ 17 ]. Usage of siRNA specifically reduced matriptase expression in matriptase/HAI-1-positive RL-952 and HEC-1A cells. Although HAI-1 gene expression did not change, matriptase/HAI-1 ratio decreased from 0.77 to 0.11 after the first knockdown, and cell invasion and migration decreased significantly.
