 Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent bioactive lipid, exerts many biological effects on different types of cells, including normal cells, and these effects include changes to cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis ⁴ . There are five types of G-protein-coupled S1P receptors, and among these receptors, S1P1-3 are the most widely expressed ⁵ . In addition, S1P can promote the motility, survival, growth, and transformation of cancer cells through multiple pathways ⁶ . It was recently reported that S1P signaling maintains the mitochondrial content of naive T cells to support their constant migration, and the expression of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1, encoded by the S1PR1 gene) in T cells inhibits the generation of Tregs but reciprocally drives the development of type 1 T helper (Th1) cells ⁷ . However, in this study, we observed that extensive S1P1 expression in BC tissues was positively associated with the number of tumor-infiltrated Tregs, and the levels of both S1P1 and Treg showed prognostic implications in BC patients. Mechanistic analyses revealed that S1P1 promoted BC-associated (i)Treg induction and (n)Treg recruitment in vitro through tumor-derived TGF-β and IL-10 secretion. In summary, these findings uncover tumor-cell-specific S1P1 function, namely, the induction of tumor-associated Treg expansion in BC, and suggest that S1P1 serves as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for BC patients.
