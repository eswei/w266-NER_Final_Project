 Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 3 (FHH3) (OMIM #600740) represents a clinically more severe form of FHH, which may be associated with symptomatic hypercalcaemia, osteoporosis, osteomalacia and cognitive dysfunction ( 8 , 9 ). FHH3 is caused by mutations of the adaptor-related protein complex 2 (AP2) sigma subunit (AP2σ), encoded by the AP2S1 gene which consists of five exons (Fig. 1). AP2, which is a ubiquitously expressed heterotetrameric protein comprising α, β, µ and σ subunits ( 10 ) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1), plays a fundamental role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the CaSR. The AP2 complex operates as two heterodimers, one comprised of the AP2α and AP2σ subunits, and the other the AP2β and AP2µ subunits ( 11–13 ) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In the inactive state, the AP2α and AP2β subunits form a diamond-shaped outer complex, and the AP2µ and AP2σ subunits, are buried within the core of the AP2 complex ( 10–12 , 14–16 ). Upon activation, AP2α and AP2β bend away from each other, with the AP2σ subunit accompanying AP2α and the AP2µ subunit being displaced toward the plasma membrane ( 11 , 12 , 14 ). In this open conformation, the AP2µ and AP2σ subunits bind to endocytic motifs on transmembrane cargo proteins, and thereby facilitate the association of clathrin with the AP2 complex ( 12 , 14 , 17 ).
