 Bioinformatics prediction revealed that miR-454 may target VGLL4 for binding. It has been reported that miR-454 is differentially expressed in colon cancer ²⁶ , renal cancer ²⁷ , and esophageal cancer ²⁸ . In these cancers, overexpression of miR-454 can promote the proliferation of colon cancer cells ²⁶ . High expression of miR-454 in patients with triple-negative breast cancer indicates lower disease-free survival and overall survival than that indicated by low expression of miR-454. Meanwhile, high expression of miR-454 indicates a poor prognosis in TNBC ²⁹ . The results confirmed that overexpression of miR-454 significantly promoted proliferation. The downregulation of miR-454 expression reverses the above biological functions, and thus, the results demonstrate that miR-454 may promote tumorigenesis in TNBC. Importantly, our data demonstrated that miR-454 can directly bind to the 3′-UTR of VGLL4 mRNA. In addition, miR-454 overexpression inhibited the expression of the VGLL4 protein in TNBC cells, while the VGLL4 protein was upregulated after inhibition of miR-454. Thus, miR-454 may downregulate VGLL4 expression by blocking its translation. High expression of miR-454 may be one of the causes of low VGLL4 expression in TNBC samples. The miR-454-VGLL4 axis may provide a new direction for clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy for TNBC.
