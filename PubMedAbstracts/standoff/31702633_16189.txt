 AAU is the most common form of immune-mediated uveitis, which was suggested to be strongly associated with HLA-B27 and AS and other seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA).[ ⁴⁴ ] Recent publications have shown that AAU has been associated with the early onset of SpA in HLA-B27-positive patients.[ ⁴⁵ ] Maksymowych et al. suggested that the frequency of LMP2 gene polymorphism was significantly different in AS patients with and without a history of AAU.[ ³¹ ] At the same time, LMP2 gene polymorphism was correlated with the incidence of peripheral joints of AS. Studies have reported that there were significant differences between the normal population and patients with AS alone and those with AAU history (P < .05) but also between the normal population and patients with AS alone and those with AAU history (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the latter two groups, indicating that there was a significant increase in LMP2 AA genotype in patients with AAU alone.[ ⁴⁶ ] Therefore, the increased frequency of the AA genotype or allele A of the LMP2 gene is not only correlated with the occurrence of AS AAU but also correlated with the occurrence of pure AAU. Homozygous AA was associated with the incidence of AS +AAU or pure AAU, but the cause was not clear. According to previous data, the LMP2 AA genotype may have linkage imbalance with HLA-B27, which may independently play a role in the pathogenesis of AAU.[ ²⁸ ] In our meta-analysis, no association was found between all the genetic models of LMP CofI polymorphism, which was in contrast with previous work conducted by Maksymowych et al.[ ¹⁶ , ¹⁹ ] Based on the larger sample size in the present meta-analysis, we may conclude that the LMP CofI polymorphism might not be a susceptible factor for AAU.
