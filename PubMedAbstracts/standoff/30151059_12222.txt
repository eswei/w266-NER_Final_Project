 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on PGRN and obesity-related markers in Chinese children. We found that serum PGRN concentrations were 1.5-fold higher in obese children, comparing to controls with normal weight. We also found that PGRN levels were positively correlated with BMI, TG, and TC in obese children. Our results were consistent with previous studies by Alissa and colleagues, who classified Saudi Arabia children into four groups based on quartiles of serum PGRN levels and found that children within the upper quartile of serum PGRN concentration were heavier and had higher concentrations of serum TC and TGs comparing to those in the lower quartile [ 22 ]. Moreover, in the previous study conducted by Qu et al., it was found that circulating PGRN concentrations were higher in obese group than healthy subjects and correlated positively with BMI [ 8 ]. Consistently, Li et al. [ 23 ] proved that serum PGRN concentrations were significantly higher in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) than in subjects without MS and correlated positively with BMI and waist circumference. Results of these studies all indicate that increased circulating PGRN concentrations were closely related to measures of obesity, both in adults and children. The reasons behind elevated serum PGRN in obese subjects are still a matter of discussion. Our findings shed some light, implying that enhanced synthesis of this adipokine may result from augmented adipose tissue in obese subject, since adipose tissue matrix expresses PGRN gene [ 10 ], and it is the important source for circulating PGRN [ 24 ]. To verify this hypothesis, further studies are needed to analyze the expression of PGRN expression in adipose tissue in obese subjects.
