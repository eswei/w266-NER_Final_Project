 Our results show that patterns of CSF biomarker levels differed in each group, with the AD group exhibiting significantly higher levels of p-Tau and t-Tau, lower Aβ₁₋₄₂ levels, and, consequently, a lower Aβ₁₋₄₂/p-Tau ratio, as expected. 4 In the AD group, cognitive performance correlated only with p-Tau levels. Increased levels of p-Tau are considered to strengthen sensitivity for differential diagnosis of AD 24 and were capable of differentiating AD from OD in our sample. Seppälä et al. 28 described a correlation between decreasing rates of p-Tau and MMSE scores in AD, which was interpreted as a sign of progressive neuronal loss. Rolstad et al. 9 described a more significant impact of CSF Aβ₁₋₄₂ levels in episodic memory and visuospatial abilities, while t-Tau levels correlated better with episodic memory in patients with dementia. In 2013, Rolstad et al. 26 replicated their study and confirmed that Aβ₁₋₄₂ and t-Tau levels in CSF were associated with semantic and working memory performance, with the effect size of t-Tau levels being larger than that of Aβ₁₋₄₂. Rami et al. 27 also found a correlation between memory performance and CSF Aβ₁₋₄₂ levels in AD. However, negative reports have also been published. 11 , 29 More recently, Mandecka et al. 30 described an association between the severity of verbal memory impairment and the degree of CSF abnormalities in AD.
