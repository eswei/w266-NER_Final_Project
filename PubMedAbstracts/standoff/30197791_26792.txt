 In this study, we found that the expression of PVT1 was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal ovarian tissues. On the contrary, the expression of miR-214 was obviously lower in tumor tissues than in normal ovarian tissues. Similar results were also found in ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro. Moreover, higher PVT1 expression was associated with advanced FIGO stage. Lower miR-214 expression was related to EOC featuring lower tumor differentiation and an advanced stage. In general, higher expression of PVT1 and lower expression of miR-214 indicated a clinically more malignant EOC, with a negative relationship between the expression of PVT1 and miR-214 in EOC tissues. Importantly, univariate survival analysis revealed that EOC patients with high PVT1 expression and low miR-214 expression were more likely to have shorter PFS and OS than those with low PVT1 expression and high miR-214 expression. Our results were quite consistent with those of previous studies. Zhang et al. ²⁰ reported that PVT1 was up-regulated in cervical cancer tissues. Enhanced expression of PVT1 was associated with larger tumor size, advanced stage, and poor prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. Kong et al. ¹⁴ indicated the overexpression of PVT1 was suggestive of a poor prognosis of gastric cancer and promoted cell proliferation through epigenetic regulation of p15 and p16. Similarly, Takahashi et al. ²¹ demonstrated that amplification of PVT1 is involved in poor prognosis via apoptosis inhibition in colorectal cancer.
