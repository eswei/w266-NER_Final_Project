 LAT2 has been reported to play different roles in multiple tumor types. Barollo et al. confirmed that LAT2 was overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors, including pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma, compared with normal tissues and that it was responsible for dihydroxyphenylalanine uptake [ 11 ]. Luo et al. found that LAT2 might play important roles in the proliferation of uterine leiomyoma cells [ 12 ]. In breast cancer, SLC7A8 mRNA expression was elevated in samples from estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer patients. However, a high level of SLC7A8 mRNA was significantly associated with longer relapse-free survival in estrogen receptor alpha-positive and lymph node-positive breast cancer [ 13 ]. Our study demonstrated that a high LAT2 level was associated with poor overall survival in pancreatic cancer. In terms of chemosensitivity, Rumiato et al. found that single nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to the SLC7A8 gene, in combination with clinical variables, could contribute to the accuracy of the predicted response to platinum chemotherapy in esophageal cancer patients [ 14 ]. Meanwhile, another study showed that the expression of the SLC7A8 gene was significantly decreased in the paclitaxel-resistant W1 human ovarian cancer cell line compared with W1 parental cells; thus, SLC7A8 might be involved in reversing drug resistance in ovarian cancer [ 15 ]. However, in our previous study, LAT2 showed a higher expression level in AsPC-1-GEM cells than in the parental cells. In this study, we also demonstrated that LAT2 played an oncogenic role in pancreatic cancer and could decrease GEM sensitivity by regulating the glutamine-dependent LAT2-mTOR-LDHB pathway.
