 The family of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are essential mediators of signaling pathways involved in cellular functions and associated with progression and treatment of various cancers [ 14 ]. As a member of the TRP family, transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) is a Ca²⁺-permeable cation channel [ 15 ] and is required for the transduction of moderately cold temperatures [ 16 , 17 ]. Initially, human TRPM8 was known as trp-p8 and has been identified to have a high expression level in prostate cancer [ 18 ]. Moreover, increased expression of TRPM8 was found in prostate cancer cells and it emerged as a promising prognostic marker in prostate cancer [ 19 ]. In fact, more and more reports have suggested that TRPM8 plays vital functions in carcinogenesis of many cancers, including melanoma [ 20 ], bladder cancer [ 21 ], oral cancer [ 22 ], lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer [ 18 ]. More importantly, studies on the relationship between TRPM8 and tumors reveal that high expression of TRPM8 appears to be associated with poor prognosis [ 23 , 24 ]. Hence, TRPM8 had been reported to be a valuable prognostic biomarker and might be a potential treatment target [ 25 ]. It has reported that TRPM8 expression is elevated in PC, and the aberrantly over-expressed TRPM8 is required for cellular proliferation and invasion [ 26 , 27 ]. However, its clinical significance in prognosis for PC has not been previously reported. The present study investigated the potential of TRPM8 as a prognostic biomarker in PC patients.
