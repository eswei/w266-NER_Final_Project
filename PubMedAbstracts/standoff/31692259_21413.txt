 Emerging evidence has revealed that autophagy process, which degrades intracellular components through the lysosomal machinery, plays an essential role in the process of cancer development and progression (Avalos et al., 2014; Mizushima, Levine, Cuervo, & Klionsky, 2008), while ATGs could control autophagic formation, and directly or indirectly accelerate cancer development and progression (Levine & Kroemer, 2008). Xie et al. (2016) identified that ATG10 rs10514231, rs1864182 and rs1864183 were associated with poor lung cancer survival and positively correlated with ATG10 expression. In current study, we also found ATG10 rs10514231, rs1864183, and rs4703533 were significantly associated with worse efficacy of radiotherapy at both primary tumor and lymph node. Qin et al. (2013) reported that ATG10 rs1864182 and rs10514231 were significantly associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in Chinese population. Yuan et al. (2017) also revealed that genetic variations in ATGs were significantly associated with clinical outcomes of advanced lung adenocarcinoma treated with gefitinib. Recently, Wen et al. (2018) found ATG16L2 rs10898880 contributed to a better prognosis of patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after definitive radiotherapy, and a greater risk of developing severe radiation pneumonitis. This results were similar to the findings in current study, which revealed that ATG16L2 rs10898880 was significantly associated with better efficacy of radiotherapy at both at the primary tumor and lymph node, and had a greater risk of developing grade 3–4 oral mucositis and myelosuppression.
