 Transcriptome analysis of asp1-D333A If, as we hypothesize, increased levels of IP8 in the IPP pyrophosphatase-defective strains is responsible for the observed increases in a limited set of mRNAs, then we might expect to see opposite effects on some of these IPP-responsive transcripts when IP8 synthesis is precluded by the kinase-defective asp1-D333A allele. RNA-seq analysis of poly(A)⁺ RNA from asp1-D333A cells identified six protein-coding genes that were down-regulated by at least 4-fold compared to the wild-type control (Figure 10), four of which correspond to transcripts that were upregulated in aps1Δ and/or asp1-H397A cells. [As an internal control, we affirmed that all of the reads for the asp1 transcript in the asp1-D333A strains had the intended Asp-to-Ala codon mutation.] The two top hits in the down-regulated asp1-D333A gene set were pho1 and pho84, with decrements of 20-fold and 14-fold, respectively. The ecl3 transcript was reduced 5-fold in asp1-D333A cells. SPBPB2B2.06c encoding a putative extracellular 5′ nucleotidase was 7-fold down in asp1-D333A cells. Of the other aps1Δ or asp1-H397A up-regulated genes, only mfs3 was appreciably down-regulated in asp1-D333A cells (by 3-fold). Thus, there appear to be two classes of IPP-responsive genes: those that require IP8 for normal expression and are overexpressed when IP8 levels are elevated above normal (e.g. the PHO genes); and those that do not require IP8 for normal expression but are overexpressed when IP8 levels are elevated.
