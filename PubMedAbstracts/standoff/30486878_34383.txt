 A fairly large number of miRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in HCC and affect tumor growth, migration, invasion, and drug resistance by regulating the coding and non-coding sequences of the genes [ 28 , 29 ]. miR-663a has been proven to be abnormal in many solid tumors. However, the role of miR-663a in tumorigenesis is very complicated and may be organ-specific. miR-663a consistently suppresses tumorigenic features in breast tumors [ 14 , 30 ], colon cancer [ 31 , 32 ] pancreatic cancer [ 33 – 35 ], and glioblastoma [ 15 , 16 , 36 ], but increases carcinogenic characteristics in prostate cancer [ 21 , 37 , 38 ] and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 19 , 39 , 40 ]. Currently, studies of miR-663a on HCC have yielded bidirectional results. Huang Weizhen et al. found that miR-663a was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues when compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues from the GSE21362 and TCGA databases. miR-663a inhibited HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by directly targeting HMGA2, which suggested that miR-663a may serve as an anticancer target for HCC [ 22 ]. Wang Guanyu et al. demonstrated that miR-663a was specifically downregulated and involved in the development of HBV-related HCC using microarray analyses [ 41 ]. However, Huang Yawei et al. reported that the downregulation of miR-663a suppressed HCC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis under endoplasmic reticulum stress by directly targeting TGF-β1, indicating that miR-663a acts as an oncogene in HCC under some circumstances [ 23 ].
