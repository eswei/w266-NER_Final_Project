 The clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of EGPA could be collected into ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative EGPA, and only 40% of EGPA is ANCA-positive unlike other ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAVs), which are highly positive for ANCA. While ANCA positivity is known to be associated with the symptoms and prognosis of EGPA, it has no association with the serum IgG4 level in EGPA ( 3 , 5 ); this contradiction may be attributed to cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency, or arrhythmia), which account for up to 50% of deaths in EGPA and often occur in ANCA-negative cases ( 5 , 6 ). ANCA-positive EGPA is related to vasculitic syndrome, including renal, skin, and neural involvement; however, previous studies have primarily included patients with anti-MPO ANCA because anti-PR3 ANCA is rare among patients with EGPA. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of anti-PR3 ANCA-positive EGPA with cardiac tamponade. Our patient also exhibited overlapping manifestations of ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative EGPA, similar to a previously reported case with positive anti-PR3 ANCA and extensive cardiac involvement ( 7 ).
