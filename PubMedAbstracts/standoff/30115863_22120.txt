 The variant m.4216T>C, a key SNP for defining the JT macro-haplogroup [ 34 ], leads to a non-synonymous amino acid change in the mtDNA MT-ND1 gene encoding NADH:Ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 (p.MT-ND1), one of the components of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I. Electrons coming from glucose metabolism through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are principally stored in NADH for ATP production and oxygen reduction. It has been proposed that hyperglycaemia can increase the production of the complex I substrate NADH [ 35 ]. Overproduction of NADH leads to an electron pressure on the mitochondrial electron transport chain that drives to an increase in electron leakage and the subsequent high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 36 , 37 ]. As the major enzyme implicated in NADH recycling, mitochondrial complex I impairment can lead to further increased levels of NADH [ 38 ], with the following enhancement of ROS. Altogether these mechanisms will induce oxidative stress, which has been widely reported as a central player in the development of insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cells dysfunction, and finally, type 2 diabetes [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]. A recent study has demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of complex I of mitochondrial electron transport chain improves glucose homeostasis and ameliorates hyperglycaemia [ 42 ]. Our findings bring us to hypothesize that variant m.4216T>C results in aberrant activity of complex I that, under diabetic conditions, leads to poorer glycaemic control. For this reason, we suggest that inhibitors of complex I—such as metformin and thiazolidinediones [ 43 ]—may be adequate drugs for the treatment of T2D patients belonging to the JT haplogroup.
