 Several studies identified the molecular events involved in the malignant transformation of melanoma. Transcription regulators and proto-oncogenes such as serine/threonine kinase B-Raf (BRAF), mast/stem cell growth factor receptor c-Kit (KIT), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), tumor suppressor p53 (P53), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) are associated with metastatic melanoma. In addition, mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) encoding two tumour suppressor proteins, p16 and p14, as well as genes involved in the DNA repair mechanism or the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) play an important role in the onset of melanoma ² , ⁶ . We recently reported new melanoma oncotargets, such as enolase 1, parkinsonism-associated deglycase, prostaglandin E synthase 3, nucleophosmin, and stathmin 1, playing a key role in malignant transformation ⁷ . Moreover, molecular analyses showed the central role of the PTEN/mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1 (MMAC1) in reducing cell proliferation or inducing apoptosis ⁸ , and the association of PTEN loss to melanoma ⁹ . Furthermore, angiogenesis is an important factor allowing melanoma migration and metastases. Mehnert et al. reported that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGF-R) are higher in melanomas compare to normal melanocytes ¹⁰ .
