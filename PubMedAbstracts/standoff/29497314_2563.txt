 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short-chain noncoding RNAs (20–24 nucleotides) that regulate gene function by direct binding of target mRNAs and then participating in multiple biological aspects of cancer progression, such as cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell migration, and cell angiogenesis. 9 , 10 MiRNAs have emerged as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets for therapy of human cancers, 11 , 12 including WT. 13 – 17 MiRNAs control gene expression either by degradation of target mRNAs or posttranscriptional repression through targeting the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) in a sequence-specific manner. 10 , 18 It is reported that miR-483-5p could predict an adverse prognosis in WT. 19 MiR-204 20 and miR-185 21 were also found to be significantly decreased in WT. These reports demonstrate that miRNAs play important roles in the cancer progression of WT. MiR-1180 was confirmed to be upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical tissues and cell lines. 22 It is reported that miR-1180 promoted apoptotic resistance to human HCC via activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. 23 However, the functional role of miR-1180 in WT remains unknown.
