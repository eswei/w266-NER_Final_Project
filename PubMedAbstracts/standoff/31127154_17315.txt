 The lack of increase in CSF YKL-40 in the whole DLB group agrees with previous findings in PD and DLB ³³ – ³⁷ , supporting the absence of an increase of this protein in CSF in synucleinopathies. This may suggest a lack of astroglial activation following the α-synuclein pathology. On the other hand, our group and others have shown an increase of CSF YKL-40 in AD and also FTLD-related syndromes early in the disease course ⁵ , ⁷ , ⁸ , ¹⁰ , ³⁵ , ³⁸ , ³⁹ . This contrast between synuclein- and tau-related neurodegenerative dementias suggests that YKL-40 is more involved with this second group of disorders. Moreover, we demonstrate an increase in YKL-40 in DLB patients with concomitant AD copathology when compared with DLB patients without AD copathology, suggesting that it is comorbid AD what is driving astrocytic activation in DLB. In agreement with this finding, we found that YKL-40 levels were highly correlated with t-tau and p-tau levels in DLB groups and that YKL-40 was increased in T+ DLB patients. One possible explanation to the difference in CSF YKL-40 between AD and DLB is that the α-synuclein inclusions observed in astrocytes in DLB may influence the astrocytic response toward neurodegeneration compared to tauopathies such as AD and FTLD ⁴⁰ , ⁴¹ . In addition, the astrocytic response against pathologic protein deposition in DLB seems to be linked to the presence of pathologic tau (p-tau) in the presence of concomitant AD pathology.
