 In contrast to prior studies, the present work has focused on the epigenetic regulatory role played by vitamin C in DNA demethylation, and how it may pertain to cancer treatment. Cellular 5hmC is relatively high in normal breast epithelial but decreases during malignant breast cancer progression ³ – ⁶ . The global loss of 5hmC could change genomic stability and genome-wide transcription, leading to a cascade that drives phenotypic transformation from normal breast epithelial cells to breast cancer. A means to slow, block, or even reverse the loss of 5hmC during malignant progression may ultimately open a new avenue for breast cancer prevention and treatment. Our comparison of gene expression in breast cancers and corresponding healthy breast tissue from the same patients revealed that the vitamin C transporter SVCT2 is downregulated in a majority of breast cancer cases from the TCGA dataset. Notably, TET expression was not consistently lost and indeed expression of the 3 TETs was variably increased in cancers compared to healthy breast cells. Since vitamin C is a cofactor for TETs and enhances 5hmC generation ¹¹ – ¹⁵ , supplementation of vitamin C might compensate for the decreased SVCT2 expression and oppose the loss of 5hmC in breast cancer.
