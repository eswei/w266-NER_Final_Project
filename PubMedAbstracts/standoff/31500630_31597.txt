 In our previous studies, we classified that IGF-1 induced the dephosphorylation of PTEN and up-regulated cellular invasiveness and proliferation through PI3K–PTEN–Akt–NFkappaB signaling pathway. We also found a negative correlation between PTEN expression and liver metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of PTEN enhanced the invasiveness and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells [ 22 , 23 ]. Several studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of PTEN inhibits cell growth in a variety of cancer cell lines [ 24 ]. Furthermore, it is well known that PTEN is suppressed in a variety of cancers and that PTEN protein plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of multiple human cancer cells, including colorectal cancer [ 25 ]. PTEN expression is decreased in colorectal cancers compared with its expression in polyps and normal mucosa. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that PTEN expression is decreased in approximately 40% colorectal cancers, often in association with a PTEN mutation or deletion [ 26 ]. In addition to colorectal cancer, the loss or reduced expression of PTEN has been found to occur in other cancers, most notably breast, prostate and gastric carcinomas [ 27 , 28 ]. Furthermore, the expression of PTEN protein was found to be decreased in the distal colon and rectum in animal studies overexpression of PTEN in colorectal cancer cells has been found to result in cell cycle arrest and enhanced cell death through the inhibition of PI3K [ 29 ]. It is interesting to speculate whether decreased PTEN expression may contribute to propensity for cancer in the more distal colon and rectum. In our results, the expression levels of PTEN mRNA is significantly reduced in highly liver metastatic colon cancer cell line HT-29 than in low liver metastatic colon cancer cell lines CaCo-2 and Colo320.
