 In addition, elevated levels of apoA1 and apoB were detected in the serum of psoriatic patients compared to the serum of control group individuals.[ ⁸ , ²⁸ ] However, there are also contrary results showing decreased levels of apolipoproteins.[ ¹⁰ ] ApoA1 plays an important role in the reverse cholesterol transport from the peripheral cells to the liver, and a lower level of apoA1 is associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis. The lower serum level of apoA1 in the inflammatory tissues might lead to the reduction of circulating HDL and thus increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in psoriatic patients.[ ²⁹ ] In our study, the apoA1 level was significantly decreased in the psoriatic patients, and there was a strong correlation between apoA1 and HDL (r = 0.584, P <.001). An elevated level of apoB is associated with the increased risk of atherosclerosis because of its role in cholesterol accumulation in the endothelium. The level of apoB in our patient group was higher than in the control group, but there was no significant difference. ApoE is essential for the normal transformation and metabolic processes involved in lipoproteins, and it also modulates TG and LDL levels.[ ³⁰ ] Veletza et al[ ³⁰ ] found that the downregulation of apoE expression and the normalization of the apoE level preceded clinical improvement, suggesting that the apoE gene might play a role in psoriasis. In contrast, no significant elevation of apoE in patients was noted, but the levels of TG (r = 0.630, P <.001) and LDL (r = 0.265, P <.001) in psoriasis were positively correlated with apoE.
