 In addition, an animal-based study showed that the level of kynurenine (a neurotoxic metabolite of tryptophan) during ischemia was increased in the brain [ 15 ]. Interestingly, kynurenine may activate an aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (ligand-activated transcription factor), and the activation is deleterious to cerebral ischemia. Accordingly, the study showed that the Ah receptor was overexpressed in the mouse brain after an experimental stroke, mainly in the neurons located at the peri-infarct and ischemic core. Similarly, increased expression of the Ah receptor was found in cultured rat cortical neurons after in vitro experimental ischemia [ 26 ]. Besides kynurenine, the level of another neurotoxic metabolite, i.e., quinolinic acid, was increased after transient ischemia in gerbils. This study was aimed to further elucidate the role of the TRYCATs pathway during a stroke in the Polish population. Therefore, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated in the presented study. The studied SNPs were localized in the genes encoding the enzymes involved in the TRYCATs pathway, including tryptophan hydroxylase, kynurenine aminotransferase, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Moreover, in this study, the further analysis included gen-gen interaction, haplotype and risk of stroke.
