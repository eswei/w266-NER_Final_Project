 Accumulating studies have demonstrated the essential functions of circRNAs in cancers, including CRC. 2 Several evidences reveal that circRNAs participate in regulating various life processes of CRC cells, such as differentiation, proliferation and migration. For example, hsa_circ_0136666 increases the growth and metastasis of CRC by modulating miR-136/SH2B1 pathway. 12 CircRNA_100290 contributes to CRC development via miR-516b/FZD4/Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling cascade. 13 Overexpression of hsa_circ_0000069 enhances the growth and metastasis of CRC. 14 However, the relationship between circRNA and CRC progression still remains poorly explored. And the roles of hsa_circRNA_102958 are largely unknown. In our study, we found that hsa_circRNA_102958 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues. Through CCK8 and colony formation assays, we demonstrated that hsa_circRNA_102958 promotes CRC cell proliferation. By using Transwell assay, we revealed that hsa_circRNA_102958 silencing suppressed migration and invasion of CRC cells. Xenograft assay also demonstrated the oncogenic roles of hsa_circRNA_102958. Taken together, our work demonstrated that hsa_circRNA_102958 promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo.
