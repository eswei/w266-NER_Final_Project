 ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4 encode for B1 and A4 subunits of the apical H⁺-ATPase pump, respectively, and mutations in these genes cause autosomal recessive (AR) forms of dRTA with or without sensorineural hearing loss. 4 5 Mutations in SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4 member 1), encoding the basolateral anion (Cl−/HCO₃−) exchanger 1 (AE1), can cause both dominant and recessive form of dRTA. 1 AE1 is expressed not only in the α-intercalated cells, but also in the erythrocytes (erythrocyte membrane protein band 3). Therefore, SLC4A1 mutations can cause dRTA and/or hemolytic anemia with abnormal red cell morphology. 6 7 SLC4A1 mutations were initially reported to be always associated with autosomal dominant (AD) form of dRTA. 6 AR dRTA caused by SLC4A1 mutations have been reported mostly from tropical Southeast Asia and other tropical areas, therefore called as tropical recessive dRTA. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Here, we report three Lao patients from two unrelated families with AR dRTA in association with the same homozygous SLC4A1 mutation, p.Gly701Asp.
