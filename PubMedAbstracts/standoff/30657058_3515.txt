 Although MYCN gene amplification and/or N-Myc oncoprotein overexpression is found in ~ 40% NEPC [ 5 ] and up to 20% CRPC without neuroendocrine phenotype [ 13 ], they are also found in ~ 5% PCA [ 5 , 28 ], suggesting that these amplification events can arise early before hormonal therapy. Two recent studies have firmly established N-Myc as an oncogenic driver for NEPC tumorigenesis [ 13 , 22 ]. Lee et al. took advantage of their tissue recombination system to demonstrate that N-Myc overexpression in human prostate epithelial cells, together with activated AKT (Myr-Akt), can initiate both PCA and NEPC tumorigenesis and the resulted N-Myc/Myr-Akt tumors are castration resistant and metastatic with low level of AR expression [ 22 ]. Dardenne et al. utilized transgenic animal models to show that N-Myc can cooperate with EZH2 to drive the progression from CRPC-Ade to CRPC-NE and the co-operation confers the resistance to the newer generation of AR-targeted therapies including Enzalutamide [ 13 ]. N-Myc overexpression, whatever in PCA or in CPRC stage, shuts down AR signaling that is required for prostate cancer growth, and as a consequence should benefit the N-Myc overexpressed prostate tumors to AR-targeted therapies. However, the N-Myc overexpressed prostate tumors are resistant to AR-targeted therapies, including ADT and Enzalutamide, indicating that N-Myc re-establishes other AR-independent pro-survival mechanisms/pathways to drive the disease progression and therapeutic resistance development. Unfortunately, these N-Myc-induced new pro-survival mechanisms/pathways remain largely unknown.
