 Innate immunity is the first line of host defence. Compared with CRP, PTX3, produced only by the liver, is secreted by different cell types corresponding to infection, pro‐inflammatory stimulation and endotoxemia.22, 23, 24 Dias et al showed that PTX3 transgenic mice were more resistant to sepsis.25 Our study revealed that plasma PTX3 levels could be used to evaluate sepsis and septic shock on the first day of sepsis onset. In addition, our study confirmed that circulating PTX3 levels were elevated in sepsis patients and were even higher in septic shock patients, the results of which were similar to previous studies of others.26 It was also found that PTX3 levels in sepsis and septic shock patients had much more significant correlations with traditional immune parameters than in post‐surgery patients. Pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐⍺ and IL‐1β were excessively activated since sepsis was induced by severe infections, which induced the expression of PTX3.27 Aaton et al showed that PTX3 regulated the development of atherosclerosis by enhancing the production of IL‐10 in vitro. However, the PTX3 stimulation did not result in the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL‐6 and TNF‐⍺.28 The study presented significant and valuable AUCs for discriminating sepsis or septic shock from healthy and post‐surgery controls. Previous studies showed that PTX3 had significant correlations with APACHE II score and SOFA score in sepsis and septic shock patients.26, 29 Moreover, the plasma PTX3 level could predict 90 mortalities in sepsis patients.29 Thus, novel biomarker such as PTX3 might help improve the early diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock.
