 To our best of knowledge, SPINT2 has not been reported as an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. In current study, we also detected the SPINT2 expression by IHC tissue array analysis. We found the SPINT2 expression in NSCLC was much lower than that in the adjacent noncancerous samples. Decreased SPINT2 expression was positively correlated to tumor invasion, distant metastasis, differentiation, and AJCC 8th stage. Moreover, we found low SPINT2 expression strongly correlated with worse overall survival in NSCLC, LUAD, and LUSC patients. These patients with low SPINT2 expression had a significantly shorter overall survival time than those with high expression. When combining STYK1 and SPINT2 expression for further analyses, Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that patients with high STYK1/low SPINT2 had the worst prognosis in NSCLC, LUAD and LUSC. This result also suggested that elevated STYK1 and decreased SPINT2 promoted NSCLC progression. Interestingly, LUAD with low STYK1/low SPINT2 showed no statistically difference of patients’ survival compared with high STYK1/high SPINT2 group; whereas LUSC with high STYK1/high SPINT2 showed better prognosis than LUSC with low STYK1/low SPINT2. These results indicated that the expression and function of STYK1 and SPITN2 may be affected and regulated by other potential signaling cascades and mechanisms in different NSCLC subtypes, which warrants further investigation.
