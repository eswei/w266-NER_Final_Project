 Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly devastating cancer. Ca²⁺-dependent channels are now considered key regulators of tumor progression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of non-voltage gated Ca²⁺ channels and Ca²⁺-dependent potassium channels (KCa) with CRC using the transcriptional profile of their genes. Methods: We selected a total of 35 genes covering KCa channels KCNN1–4, KCNMA1 and their subunits KCNMB1–4, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium sensors STIM1 and STIM2, Ca²⁺ channels ORAI1–3 and the family of cation channels TRP (TRPC1–7, TRPA1, TRPV1/2,4–6 and TRPM1–8). We analyzed their expression in two public CRC datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE39582. Results: KCNN4 and TRPM2 were induced while KCNMA1 and TRPM6 were downregulated in tumor tissues comparing to normal tissues. In proximal tumors, STIM2 and KCNN2 were upregulated while ORAI2 and TRPM6 were downregulated. ORAI1 decreased in lymph node metastatic tumors. TRPC1 and ORAI3 predicted poor prognosis in CRC patients. Moreover, we found that ORAI3/ORAI1 ratio is increased in CRC progression and predicted poor prognosis. Conclusions: KCa and Ca²⁺ channels could be important contributors to CRC initiation and progression. Our results provide new insights on KCa and Ca²⁺ channels remodeling in CRC.
