 FGF 19 has an essential role in NAFLD. Liver specimens from patients with NAFLD had increased endoplasmic reticulum stress [ 48 , 49 ] and chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress has been linked to fatty liver disease [ 50 ] owing to increased FFA flux into the liver [ 51 ]. Lack of the FGF15/19 gene exacerbated endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased hepatic steatosis in response to a high-fat diet [ 50 ]. FGF 19 transgenic mice did not develop obesity and DM on a high-fat diet by reducing fat mass, increasing energy expenditure, increasing insulin sensitivity, and reducing hepatosteatosis [ 52 ]. Patients with NAFLD and insulin resistance had an impaired hepatic response to FGF19, leading to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis [ 53 ]. Obesity showed an association between decreased FGF19 levels and NAFLD [ 54 ]. Our study corresponds to the above, and further investigates the FGF 19 and FLI score on NAFLD in patients with obesity and T2DM after SG. In different metabolic surgery, SG had a better capability to normalize liver function test than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with obesity and T2DM 1 year after surgery [ 55 ]. Non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis scores, including aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, NAFLD fibrosis score, BARD score, and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, have been used to evaluate the improvement of NAFLD after SG [ 56 ]. We also found that the FL-I group had lower FGF 19 levels, lower body weight, and lower waist circumferences among the patients with obesity and T2DM before surgery. A decreased FGF19 level might be an important risk factor for NAFLD [ 54 ]. In addition, our study suggests that the preoperative FGF 19 levels â‰¤ 49.97 pg/mL have a predictive role in fatty liver improvement 1 year after surgery.
