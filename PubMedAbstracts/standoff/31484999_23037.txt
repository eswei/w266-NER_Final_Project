 We also found that MA-35 reduced fibrosis in the colon (Figs 3e and 4b). Intestinal fibrosis is a common and devastating outcome in patients with IBD and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality ¹⁸ – ²⁰ . TGF-β₁ is known to promote the transcription of fibrosis-associated molecules, such as collagens ⁴⁴ , and leads to the development of intestinal fibrosis. The serum levels of TGF-β₁ and its mRNA expression levels are also known to increase in patients with IBD ⁴⁵ . In an IBD mouse model, such as DSS- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-treated mice, the inhibition of the TGF-β₁/Smad pathway reduced intestinal fibrosis ⁴⁶ , ⁴⁷ . Kashima et al. reported that Lactobacillus brevis-derived polyphosphate downregulated the TGF-β₁/Smad pathway to affect both the intestinal epithelia and macrophages ⁴⁶ . Li et al. also reported that pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, inhibited fibroblast proliferation and TGF-β signaling ⁴⁷ . We found that MA-35 reduced the fibrotic cytokines Tgfb1 and Fn1 and intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β₁/Smad pathway in an AOM/DSS mouse model. In this scenario, MA-35 could be a potential therapeutic drug candidate for fibrosis, not just anti-inflammation and antitumorigenic effects.
