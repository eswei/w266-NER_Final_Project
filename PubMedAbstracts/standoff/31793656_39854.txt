 As the functional binding of sLeˣ/sLeᵃ antigens with E-selectins is crucially dependent on their presentation by scaffold proteins ( 59 - 61 ), their mere detection has limited prognostic value in different cancers ( 62 - 64 ). Thus, the identification of sLeˣ/sLeᵃ -decorated protein scaffolds is expected to provide more specific and reliable clinical biomarkers. While carriers of E-selectin ligands have been identified in several types of cancer, including the CD44 glycoform known as hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand in colon cancer, and CEA in colon and prostate cancer ( 65 , 66 ), no functionally defined E-selectin ligands were identified in NSCLC to date. Here, the data indicated that CEA decorated by sLeˣ/sLeᵃ acts as a functionally relevant E-selectin ligand. Thus, CEA interactions with endothelial selectins may the mediate tethering, rolling and adhesion of tumour cells to the endothelium, consequently promoting cancer metastasis. CEA is a glycoprotein with low and limited expression in normal tissues, but is detected at high levels in tumours with epithelial origin, including NSCLC, gastric carcinoma and colorectal cancer, for which it is used as a tumour biomarker ( 67 ). Serum CEA in patients with NSCLC correlates with advanced stage of the disease, poor therapeutic response, early relapse and shorter survival ( 35 , 68 ). Notably, besides cell adhesion, CEA also serves key functions in intracellular and intercellular signalling involved in cancer progression, inflammation, angiogenesis and metastasis ( 69 ). Thus, CEA-E-selectin interactions may also contribute to these malignant features. Although CEA and sLeˣ/sLeᵃ have been extensively suggested as clinical biomarkers in NSCLC ( 12 , 70 , 71 ), to our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the functional relevance of sLeˣ/sLeᵃ-associated CEA as an E-selectin ligand in primary NSCLC tissue.
