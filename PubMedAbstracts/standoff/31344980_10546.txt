 In 1994, Schwertner et al. [ 56 ] reported serum bilirubin levels to be low in patients with CAD. Since then, many studies showed bilirubin levels to be lower in patients with CAD than without CAD and to inversely correlate with the severity of CAD [ 57 , 58 , 59 ]. Low bilirubin levels in blood may thus play a promotive role in the development of CAD. Genetic variations in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene are known to be major determinants of serum bilirubin level [ 60 ]. However, Stender et al. [ 61 ] investigated the associations between the UGT1A1 gene genotype and plasma bilirubin levels and between genetically elevated bilirubin levels and CAD in 67,068 subjects. They demonstrated that genetically elevated bilirubin levels were not associated with a decreased risk of CAD. They also performed a meta-analysis of 11 studies and showed no association between genetically elevated bilirubin levels and CAD. These findings thus suggest no causal relationship between elevated bilirubin levels and CAD. Since increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, low bilirubin levels in patients with CAD may not be a cause of CAD but rather a result of increased oxidative stress, leading to the consumption of endogenous anti-oxidants [ 52 ].
