 Several mechanisms of acquired and adaptive resistance are known to converge on MAPK pathway in NSCLC ²⁰ . We observed that erlotinib-resistant SCC-R cells were highly sensitive to MAP2K1/2 inhibitor (PD-0325901) compared to SCC-S cells. High efficacy of PD-0325901 towards SCC-R cells could be due to increased binding affinity of the drug to mutant MAP2K1. It has been reported that PD-0325901 has as increased potency towards activated MAP2K1 ⁶³ . Treatment with PD-0325901 resulted in decreased levels of pMAP2K1 and pMAPK1/3 in SCC-R cells indicating inhibition of MAPK pathway in these cells. Together, our results indicate that in erlotinib resistant SCC-R cells, activation of Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling axis is an important survival mechanism. Genes related to MAPK pathway are altered at a frequency of 4–15% across HNSCC cohorts while mRNA overexpression of MAPK pathway genes is seen in around 30% of HNSCC patients. These results from TCGA data indicate that MAPK pathway might be a potential driver in a subset of HNSCC patients and targeting MAPK pathway might be a useful strategy in a subset of HNSCC patients.
