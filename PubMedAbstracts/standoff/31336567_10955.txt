 Recent reports have shown TMAO to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and established the close relationship between TMAO and CVD progression [ 4 ]. Elevated levels of TMAO are shown to promote vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to atherosclerosis [ 32 , 33 , 34 ]. TMAO was also shown to promote heart failure in pressure overload-induced heart failure [ 34 ]. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of vascular damage, leading to the development of atherosclerosis resulting in CVD, and is considered as an early marker for atherosclerosis. Circulating TMAO levels were shown to enhance vascular inflammation and oxidative stress and contribute to endothelial dysfunction in aged rats [ 2 ]. In addition, TMAO was shown to contribute to endothelial dysfunction via inhibiting eNOS expression and reducing NO production [ 9 , 16 , 32 , 33 ]. Both in in vivo and in vitro studies in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells, physiological levels of TMAO are shown to induce expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules, resulting in leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis. Previous work from our group has also explored the role of TMAO associated endothelial dysfunction via NLRP3 inflammasomes, suggesting the important role of TMAO in CVD progression [ 35 ]. However, the exact mechanisms for TMAO associated endothelial dysfunction resulting in cardiovascular diseases are still unclear. In this regard, the present study for the first time found that TMAO upregulated HMGB1 expression, and such increased HMGB1 contributes to the TMAO associated endothelial dysfunction.
