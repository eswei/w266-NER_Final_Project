 We performed a DNA microarray analysis to explore biomarkers associated with NASH in STAM mice and observed significant expression changes in 46 genes in the STAM group (Table 6). Expression levels of SAA1 and SAA2, which are inflammation-related genes, were increased in the STAM group. In addition, we assayed SAA protein levels. The SAA level at 8 weeks was significantly higher in the STAM group mice than in the normal group mice (Fig. 5). It is reported that providing an HFD or an HFD with cholesterol (HFC) induces an increase in the expression levels of SAA in the liver [ 29 , 34 ]. However, expression levels of SAA in hyperlipidemic (low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient) HFC-fed mice, which develop NASH, increase much more than those in wild-type HFC-fed C57BL/6J mice [ 34 ]. In this study, expression levels of SAA1 and SAA protein levels markedly increased about 15- and 5-fold, respectively, in the STAM mice. Therefore, we speculated that liver inflammation rather than an HFD has a great impact on the gene expression and protein levels of SAA. SAA is an acute phase protein that is produced predominantly by the liver and increases in response to inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it exhibits significant immunological activity by inducing the synthesis of several cytokines, by being chemotactic for neutrophils and mast cells, and by activating the inflammasome cascade, which has a key role in immune activation [ 7 ]. Thus, SAA is targeted for the treatment of diseases associated with chronic inflammation [ 7 ]. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), which can be measured in humans, increases when there is inflammation in the body. However, we cannot measure CRP in mice. Accordingly, SAA was considered a useful biomarker for evaluating inflammation in STAM mice with NASH.
