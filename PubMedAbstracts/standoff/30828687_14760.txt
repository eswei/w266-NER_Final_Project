 In this study, we confirmed the enhanced Ser‐71 phosphorylation of Rac1/Cdc42 protein in the osteoclast from the ADOII patient and ClC‐7 knockdown BMMs. Ser‐71 phosphorylated Rac1/Cdc42 appear to be in their active conformation according to pull‐down assay with PAK CRIB‐domain and Rho‐GDI.28 Both Rac1 and Cdc42 belong to GTPases of the Rho subfamily that exert on the actin cytoskeleton as well as differentiation and function of osteoclast.29, 30 However, evidence showed that the phosphorylation of Rac1 at Ser‐71 by Akt may inhibit GTP binding of Rac1, attenuating the signal transduction pathway downstream of Rac1.28, 31, 32 It is quite possible that the enhanced phosphorylation of Cdc42 can be associated with the augmented osteoclast differentiation in the ADOII patient. Cdc42 is well known to have a multifunctional role during osteoclastogenesis, which promotes proliferation and differentiation in osteoclast precursors and affects polarization of mature osteoclasts.30 Osteoclasts with dysfunctional G215R ClC‐7 can have an increased intracellular chloride level,20 which can lead to the enhanced activation of Cdc42 and osteoclast differentiation.
