 In the current study, another protective effect of maternal melatonin therapy on hypertension is mediating NO system. We found that HF/HS rats had a higher plasma l-citrulline level compared to those in ND/ND rats and this increase was preserved by melatonin. This is in line with previous observations showing that NO deficiency due to impaired l-citrulline conversion to l-arginine contributes to hypertension [ 33 , 34 ]. Our recent studies indicated that maternal melatonin therapy protects against hypertension is related to reduction of plasma levels of ADMA and SDMA and increases of l-arginine-to-ADMA ratio. Because, individually, ADMA and SDMA are inhibitors of NO synthase and the l-arginine-to-ADMA ratios represent NO bioavailability [ 35 ], our data are in agreement with previous studies showing that early treatment with melatonin could restore the ADMAâ€“NO pathway prior to hypertension in favor of NO, to prevent the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats [ 17 , 36 ]. Additionally, our current study shows that maternal melatonin therapy significantly increased Nrf2 expression. As we have recently demonstrated in other work [ 37 ], the NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate reversed combined prenatal dexamethasone exposure and post-weaning high-fat diet-induced increases of ADMA and SDMA concentrations and a decrease in the l-arginine-to-ADMA ratio. Our data suggest that maternal melatonin therapy might activate Nrf2 signaling and restore the ADMA-NO pathway, to protect against HF/HS-induced programmed hypertension.
