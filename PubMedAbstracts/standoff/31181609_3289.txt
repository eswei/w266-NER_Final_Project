 The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL belongs to the TAM (Tyro-3, AXL, and Mer) family [ 4 ]. AXL binding to its ligand, the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6), stimulates cell proliferation and survival by triggering several signaling cascades including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT1, the Janus kinase (Jak)/ Signaling transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) [ 4 ] pathways. AXL was demonstrated to sustain cancer progression also independently from the expression of its ligand [ 4 ]. AXL is frequently overexpressed in human cancers [ 5 ], where it is significantly associated with a poor prognosis and therapy resistance [ 4 ]. In humans, AXL was associated with metastatic disease in lung, breast, gastric, prostate, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma. Furthermore, AXL was associated to resistance to imatinib in gastrointestinal tumors, herceptin in breast cancer, and chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, AXL has been demonstrated to regulate cancer angiogenesis [ 6 ]. These findings indicate that AXL displays oncogenic activities, regulating multiple key processes associated to cancer development and progression.
