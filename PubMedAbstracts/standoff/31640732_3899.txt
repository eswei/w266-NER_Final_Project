 In addition to MMPs and ADAMTS, A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family is considered to be involved in mediating ECM degradation in OA [ 19 ]. Several of the ADAM proteins are found to be up-regulated in OA. For example, ADAM10 was found to be notably up-regulated during the progression of OA, and was confirmed to be stimulated by inflammatory factor IL-1, and was considered to be involved in cartilage degeneration [ 20 , 21 ]. ADAM9, ADAM12, ADAM15, ADAM19 and ADAM23 were also found to be up-regulated in human OA cartilage [ 22 – 24 ]. Despite that the investigations of ADAM8 are majorly from the research area of tumorigenesis [ 25 , 26 ], the role of ADAM8 in OA has been included in several studies. As identified by several studies, the expression of ADAM8 was found to be elevated in OA cartilage [ 24 , 27 , 28 ]. Importantly, Zack. MD et.al indicated that ADAM8 is a fibronectinase in human OA chondrocytes, it cleaves fibronectin at the amino acid Ala (271) [ 28 ]. This ADAM8 mediated degradation of fibronectin in cartilage may contribute to OA progress directly. Besides, ADAM8 was identified to be a regulator in rheumatoid arthritis associated osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion [ 29 – 31 ]. However, the exact role of ADAM8 in regulating the degradation of ECM, including collagens and aggrecans, and in modulating OA progression is still to be elucidated.
