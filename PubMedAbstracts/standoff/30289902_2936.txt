 However, some patients still develop resistance to RA and/or ATO. It is known that mutations in PML-RARA confer resistance to RA and ATO, and are associated with poor prognosis in APL patients [ 12 , 13 ]. Reportedly, mutations in PML-RARA were identified in about 30% and 60% of APL patients at the first and second relapse, respectively [ 14 ]. Although most acquired mutations associated with RA resistance were point mutations in PML-RARA, we identified a novel seven amino acid deletion mutation (p.K227_T233del) as well as a point mutation, p.R217S, in the RARA region of PML-RARA from an RA-resistant APL patient; however, the biological significance of these mutations was not analyzed. Here we report on the clinical and biological significance of the deletion mutation in the RARA region of PML-RARA. We demonstrated that the deletion mutation was critical for RA sensitivity, whereas p.R217S did not affect the sensitivity in vitro. Moreover, we found that RA-induced PML-nuclear body (NB) formation was affected in the APL cells harboring the deletion mutation. Our results indicate that this acquired deletion mutation in PML-RARA was a critical mechanism for the acquisition of resistance to RA therapy, and thus that it is necessary to evaluate the biological significance of such mutations to improve clinical strategies for relapse/refractory APL patients.
