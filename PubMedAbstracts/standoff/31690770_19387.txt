 Although immune checkpoint inhibitor tremendously improved overall survival for patients with diverse solid tumor types, there is no promising data from current clinical trials for the treatment of gliomas thus far ³⁰ . Many studies have demonstrated the infiltration of CD8 positive cells in GBM is normally weaker than that in tumors like melanoma and lung cancer ³¹ . Apart from the impact of immune microenviroment, intrinsically weak PD-L1 expression level in GBM may be another reason ³² . As a genomic biomarker of response to immunotherapy, TMB was also investigated in this study. It is known that the use of TMZ would induce high level of TMB, which could explain the higher TMB we observed in recurrent gliomas. Additionally, patients with MMR gene mutations correspond to higher TMB in gliomas. However, the predictive effect on DFS or OS in gliomas have yet to be studied. In this study, we found a clear trend toward better prognosis with increasing TMB in patients. Furthermore, a recent study, irrelevant to immunotherapy, has implicated that high TMB leads to better prognosis in NSCLC ²⁰ . The insignificance may be due to insufficient follow-up time.
