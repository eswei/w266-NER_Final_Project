 Multiplexed fluorescent immunoassay The concentrations of the following 28 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (Table S1) in the liquid phase of CSF were measured by multiplexed fluorescent bead‐based immunoassay as described previously:16, 17, 18, 19 pleiotropic cytokines, interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, and IL‐7; type 1 helper T cell (Th1)‐related cytokines, IL‐2, IL‐12 (p70), IL‐15, and interferon (IFN)‐γ; type 2 helper T cell (Th2)‐related cytokines, IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐9, IL‐10, and IL‐13; type 17 helper T cell (Th17)‐related cytokine, IL‐17; follicular helper T (Tfh)‐related cytokine, IL‐21; chemokines, C‐X‐C motif ligand (CXCL)8/IL‐8, CCL11/eotaxin, CXCL10/interferon gamma‐inducible protein (IP)‐10, CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)‐1, CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)‐1α, CCL4/MIP‐1β, and CCL5/regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES); growth factors, granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF), granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF)‐BB, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); and anti‐inflammatory cytokine, IL‐1 receptor antagonist (IL‐1ra). The Bio‐plex cytokine assay system (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The same lots of reagents were used throughout the experiments, and the interassay and intraassay variabilities were reported to be <10%.16, 17, 18, 19 All samples were diluted fourfold and analyzed in duplicate. Cytokine/chemokine/growth factor concentrations were calculated by reference to a standard curve for each molecule derived using various concentrations of the standard assayed in the same manner as the CSF samples. The detection limit for each molecule was determined by the recovery of the corresponding standard and the lowest value with >70% recovery was set as the lower detection limit.16, 17, 18, 19 No samples were beyond the upper detection limits, while some samples were below the lower detection limits. Each cytokine/chemokine and growth factor showed different detection rates (Table S1).
