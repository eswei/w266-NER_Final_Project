 Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) The GUCY2C isoform belongs to the particulate family of guanylate cyclases. While other cyclases (including soluble guanylate cyclase and the particulate guanylate cyclases A and B) have a widespread tissue distribution, GUCY2C is largely restricted to the intestinal tract ( 15 , 16 ). It is expressed as a homodimer on the apical brush border of intestinal epithelial cells from the duodenum to the rectum, with its ligand-binding extracellular domain facing the intestinal lumen and its intracellular catalytic domain facing the cytosol ( 12 , 14 ). GUCY2C was initially characterized as the receptor for the bacterial heat-stable enterotoxin, ST, the causative agent of traveler's diarrhea ( 7 , 17 ). Extracellular ST binding activates the catalytic domain, generating intracellular cGMP. In turn, cGMP signaling canonically drives phosphorylation and translocation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to the cell surface, triggering Cl− and HCO<formula> efflux into the intestinal lumen ( 18 – 20 ). Additionally, cGMP signaling inhibits the apical Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger 3 (NHE3), preventing Na⁺ absorption from the lumen ( 18 – 20 ). The combined electrolyte efflux and retention in the lumen produces an osmotic gradient that drives fluid secretion and, in the pathological scenario, secretory diarrhea. Given this secretory function, GUCY2C has emerged as an attractive target for the treatment of constipation syndromes ( 21 , 22 ). Two GUCY2C agonists recently received FDA-approval for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: linaclotide (Linzess™) ( 23 – 25 ) an ST analog, and plecanatide (Trulance™) ( 26 , 27 ) an analog of the endogenous GUYC2C ligand, uroguanylin (discussed below). Efficacy and tolerability of these agents was recently summarized ( 28 ).
