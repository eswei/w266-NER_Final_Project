 Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular transdifferentiation process, whereby losing the epithelial polarities and junctions, and acquiring alterations in gene expressions and behaviors which are typically correlated with mesenchymal cells [ 12 ]. Emerging evidence has also indicated that EMT process is involved tumor progression. For instance, Jeong et al. [ 13 ] found that EMT in breast cancer was related to the triple-negative phenotype and high histological grade. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathway, an important driver in carcinogenesis, is commonly dysregulated in the progression of various cancers, including cervical carcinoma [ 14 ], gastric carcinoma [ 15 ], and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 16 ]. TGF-β/Smad is a multi-functional regulator implicated in multiple processes such as cell metastases and growth [ 17 , 18 ]. TGF-β signaling pathway has been verified to function as an important cancer promoter via inducing EMT [ 19 ]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that EMT and the TGF-β/Smad pathway are involved in progression of OS. It is well-known that TGF-β1 can activate downstream mediators, such as SMAD2 and SMAD3, to exert its biological functions, while SMAD7 can negatively regulate its effects [ 20 ]. Previous studies have demonstrated that SMAD7 is one of the most vital factors in tumor development. Studies by De Simone et al. [ 21 ] showed that SMAD7 knockdown lead to colon cancer cell death via activating protein kinase RNA-associated eIF2alpha pathway. Another study by Javelaud et al. [ 22 ] revealed that stable SMAD7 overexpression inhibited the tumorigenicity in human melanoma cells. Hence, in this present study, we detected the association between SMAD7 and TGF-β signaling pathway in OS.
