 We also reported that VDR may directly regulate the MEG3 level in colorectal cells through binding to its promoter. Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that was found to be associated with CRC development and a poor prognosis ( Li et al., 2014 ). Multiple genes, including lncRNAs encoding genes such as H19 and HOTAIR have been found to be regulated by Vitamin D through VDR in multiple cancers ( Jiang and Bikle, 2014a ; Jiang and Bikle, 2014b ). Here, we found that vitamin D treatment or VDR over-expression up-regulated MEG3 expression in CRC cells. VDR may activate MEG3 expression via direct binding to its promoter at the −230 ~ − 243 promoter region. Accordingly, Menigatti et al. reported that MEG3 was epigenetically silenced in precancerous colorectal lesions, possibly leading to the reduced transcriptional level of MEG3 by VDR ( Menigatti et al., 2013 ). In clinic, VDR level was positively correlated with the MEG3 level in CRC tissues, and patients with higher VDR were associated with better OS. These results suggested that the regulation of MEG3 expression by vitamin D/VDR can partially explain why CRC patients with vitamin D deficiency showed poorer prognosis ( Duffy et al., 2017 ). The down-regulation of MEG3 might also confer the increased risk of CRC development under the vitamin D deficiency status, which needs to be addressed with more investigations.
