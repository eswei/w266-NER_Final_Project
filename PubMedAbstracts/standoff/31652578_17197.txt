 Accordingly, this study provided the first evidence that canagliflozin inhibits the progression of NASH to hepatocarcinogenesis, since the number of GS-positive tumors was significantly smaller in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. GS is a marker of HCC [ 19 ], so we used immunohistochemistry for GS to identify the liver tumors. We detected positive signals for GS in the tumor nodules, supporting a diagnosis of HCC. In the mammalian liver, GS catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia, and thus provides a source of energy for tumor cells. Immunohistochemical analysis has shown a stepwise increase of GS expression from precancerous lesions to early and advanced HCC [ 20 ]. GS-positive malignant cells are derived from GS-positive hepatocytes, suggesting that GS is a specific marker for tracing cell lineage during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. We also found that hepatic expression of mRNA for AFP (an oncofetal protein and tumor marker) was significantly lower in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. AFP is known to be a marker of hepatic progenitor cells [ 21 ]. Taken together, these findings indicate that canagliflozin inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis in this mouse model of diabetes/NASH/HCC.
