 The MTNR1B rs8192552 variant E allele is associated with reduced PFG levels. ¹⁶ Our study demonstrated that a mutant 24 E allele may have a protective role against IR in obese adolescents. Although the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect are not fully understood, the mutant allele may alter glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion. ⁴ Another possible mechanism may relate to differential regulation of the melatonin receptor in specific target tissues with crucial functions in carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver and hypothalamus). ⁴ , ¹⁶ The protective effect also may be attributable to leptin, which is associated with IR independent of obesity by imparing insulin signaling. Leptin levels are increased in individuals with MetS, but in individuals with severe MetS, adipose tissue dysfunction may lead to decreased leptin levels. ¹⁷ It could be argued, therefore, that a mutant allele may lead to the development of relative hypoleptinemia via adipose tissue dysfunction. Elevated leptin has been shown to be an independent risk factor for hyperlipidemia. ¹⁷ Brydon et al. reported that MTNR1B activation in adipose tissue leads to increased lipid levels and adipocytes. ¹¹ Surprisingly, we found that the mutant E allele was associated with reduced total cholesterol levels in morbidly obese adolescents. We speculate that a protective effect against hyperlipidemia may occur because of relative hypoleptinemia caused by adipose tissue dysfunction in morbidly obese adolescents. Our study illustrates that morbidly obese adolescents carrying an E allele may have reduced cardiometabolic risk of dyslipidemia, although further studies are required to confirm this effect.
