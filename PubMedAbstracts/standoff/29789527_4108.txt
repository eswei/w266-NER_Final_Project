 The role of RCC1 in carcinoma is uncertain. RCC1 was identified as being overexpressed in mantle-cell lymphoma ¹⁶ . Another report showed that RCC1 expression was significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues ¹⁷ . These results suggest that RCC1 may promote cancer formation. Proteomic profiling revealed that RCC1 was decreased in HepG2 hepatoma cells induced with 6-bromine-5-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde ¹⁸ . Another report demonstrated that RCC1 expression was significantly lower in gastric carcinoma tissues and that methylation-induced silencing of RCC1 expression was associated with tumorigenesis and depth of invasion in gastric cancer, suggesting that RCC1 may be a tumor suppressor in gastric carcinoma ¹⁹ . Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of the carboplatin response in chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant ovarian cancer cells indicated that RCC1 expression was higher in carboplatin-sensitive cells ²⁰ . However, in colorectal carcinoma cells, RCC1 was reported to promote doxorubicin resistance ¹⁵ . All of these data indicate that differences in RCC1 expression and function may depend on the type of tumor. Importantly, whole genome expression profiling of progressive stages of cervical cancer indicated that RCC1 was overexpressed in International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage III cervical cancer tissues compared to normal cervix ²¹ . However, the role of RCC1 in cervical cancer and in HPV E7-expressing cells is largely unknown.
