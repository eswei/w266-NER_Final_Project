 Moreover, we investigated the clinical and habitual factors associated with methylation occurrence. In the APC gene we observed that positive nodal status conferred a higher methylation rate in matched margin samples (OR=1.66; 95% CI: 0.92-3.01; p<0.1). Habitual factors linked to cigarettes were associated with higher methylation of the APC gene in tumour samples (OR=3.60; 95% CI: 0.97-13.39; p<0.1). MGMT methylation was diminished in tumour samples (OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.13-1.06; p<0.1) and in margin samples from females (OR=0.23; 95% CI: 0.06-0.84; p<0.05). Patients with a family history of cancer showed more frequently methylated MGMT genes in tumour samples (OR=3.04; 95% CI: 1.08-8.55; p<0.05). We noted that advanced tumour stage was associated with a higher frequency of methylation of this gene in matched surgical margin samples (OR=1.78; 95% CI: 0.98-3.24; p<0.1). However, patients with a history of abusing alcohol showed lower MGMT promoter methylation in the surgical margin (OR=0.13; 95% CI: 0.03-0.56; p<0.01). Analysis of the TIMP3 gene showed that the female gender conferred a higher methylation level in margin samples (OR=2.49; 95% CI: 0.89-6.95; p<0.1) and a positive N stage showed a higher methylation level in tumour samples (OR=1.79; 95% CI: 0.96-3.35; p<0.1). For the CDH1 gene, an increased methylation level was seen in tumour samples from females (OR=2.61; 95% CI: 0.88-7.73; p<0.1) and smoking was associated with higher CDH1 methylation both in tumour (OR=3.13; 95% CI: 0.91-10.80; p<0.1) and margin samples (OR=7.12; 95% CI: 0.87-59.36; p<0.1).
