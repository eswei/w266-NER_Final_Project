 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis, development and prognosis of various major diseases by degrading mRNA or by inhibiting the translation processes of target genes by binding their 3′UTRs ⁸ – ¹² . As a member of tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), miR-4521 is involved in breast cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma ¹² – ¹⁵ . Its deregulation in MCF-7 cells is accompanied by hypoxic hypoxia induction ¹³ and in enhanced malignancy of CLL and lung cancer ¹⁴ . It was one of 11 joint miRNAs implicated in the prognosis of PDAC patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy ¹² . A higher miR-4521/miR-340-5p ratio was implicated in better disease-free survival of esophageal adenocarcinoma patients with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy ¹⁵ . Except for the finding that miR-4521 was downregulated in the sunitinib-resistant ACHN and RCC23 cell lines, SR-ACHN and SR-RCC23 ¹⁶ , no study has addressed its role or regulation mechanism in ccRCC. In this study miR-4521 acted as a tumor suppresser in ccRCC. Its deficiency negatively correlated with FAM129A upregulation and prompted clinical development and progression of ccRCC. It mediated ccRCC carcinogenesis by affecting cancer cells’ malignant invasiveness via the TIMP-1/MMP2/MMP9 and MDM2/p53/Bcl2/Bax pathways.
