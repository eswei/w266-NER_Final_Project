 miRNA-microarray expression data coupled with the IPA knowledge database identified associated signaling pathways and its interacting miRNAs such as miR-181a, miR130a, and miR-328 as predominant molecules associated with drug resistance drug efflux pathway in prostate cancer. The expression of 130a/b, miR-181a, (downregulated in early-stage, upregulated in advance-stage, and downregulated in CRPC) and miR-328 (upregulated in advance-stage). Moreover, the drug resistance-drug efflux pathway showed that miR-130a/b, and miR-181a were associated with memberâ€™s ABC transporter family including P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), and breast cancer resistant protein-(BCRP) (S2 Fig). Overexpression of ABC transporter proteins is associated with the resistance of a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs [ 51 ]. Likewise, miR-146a was differentially upregulated in PC3 cells and was associated with Th1 and Th2 signaling pathway (S2 Fig). Considerable evidence showed that miR-146a was a potent inhibitor of Th1 differentiation and cell proliferation of human T cells, and dysregulation of miR-146a contributed to the pathogenesis [ 52 ].
