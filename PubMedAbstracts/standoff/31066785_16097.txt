 Animal clinical experiments have found that, NPY is associated with brain damage, stroke, and neonatal HIE ¹⁷ ⁻ ¹⁹ . HIE refers to the brain injury caused by reduced oxygen supply reduction and/or reduced blood supply secondary to late pregnancy, delivery or neonatal period. It is the main form of perinatal brain injury, and is the main cause of acute death ¹⁹ . Previous study ²⁰ finds that, in HIE patients the plasma NPY level is increased significantly. The higher the HIE level is, the higher the plasma NPY level is. The NPY level in the recovery phase is decreased significantly. This suggests that, the plasma NPY is involved in the pathophysiological process of HIE. In neonatal asphyxia, the plasma NPY is significantly increased, resulting in the increase of cerebral vascular resistance and the decrease of cerebral blood flow. This becomes one of the causes of HIE ⁶ . NPY can inhibit the vasodilation effect of blood vessels on adenosine, acetylcholine and other vasodilator substances. This causes the accommodative disorder of cerebral vasodilatation and contraction function, leading to further contraction of cerebral blood vessels and reduction of cerebral blood flow ²¹ . In addition, NPY can promote the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol on the cell membrane, producing two diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (IP3). As a second messenger, IP3 can promote the opening of Ca²⁺ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum and increase the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, thus aggravating hypoxic ischemic brain damage ²² . The results of this study showed that, NPY was mainly distributed in the hippocampus of ICP fetal rats. The expression of NPY in the experimental group was increased significantly, compared with control group. This suggests that, NPY may be related to fetal distress in ICP.
