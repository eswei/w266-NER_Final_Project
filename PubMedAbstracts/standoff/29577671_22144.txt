 Although the initial role of NFIs was demonstrated in the development of many organ systems, such as central nervous system 25 and lung 26, recent studies revealed that NFIs also play essential role in the context of cancer 7. NFIA mainly acts as a tumor‐promoting gene in glioma and ESCC 10, while NFIB exerts its oncogenic effect in SCLC, melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer and functions as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and NSCLC 11. Interestingly, Denny recently reported that chromatin in metastatic lesions exhibited a widespread increase in accessibility at gene distal regions that are enriched for NFI motifs, and NFIB regulates the expression of genes related to axon guidance, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix–receptor interactions 13. Most recently, NFIB has been shown to promote proliferation of breast cancer cells in the absence of estrogen and inhibit the transcription activity of ERα 18. Consistent with the previous study that NFIA promotes growth of ESCC cells 11, we show here that NFIA is overexpressed in ESCC tissues, and high NFIA expression correlates with poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage in ESCC. It is worth noting that although NFIB was also overexpressed in ESCC, it is of no clinicopathological value in ESCC. On the other hand, NFIB was highly expressed in EJA, and high NFIB expression is of negative prognostic value in EJA. The small sample size of EJA is a main limitation of this work. Further work is needed to validate the role of NFIB in EJA using a large sample size. The differential roles of NFIA and NFIB reflect not only the distinct features of ESCC and EJA, but also the versatile functions of NFI family members.
