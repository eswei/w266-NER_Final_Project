 Recent advancements point to a role for ATF4 mutations in mediating drug resistance in tumor cells featured by xCT overexpression 10 . Similarly, ATF4 has been proposed as a potential biomarker positively related to the efficacy of BTZ treatment 11 . The results suggest that lower expression of ATF4 is correlated with shorter progression-free survival in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Similarly, loss of function of ATF4 plays a role in initiation of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) 12 . This dependency prompted us to focus on whether ATF4 activation might also be a potent vulnerability for OS to perturbation after prolonged chemotherapy. RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is required for normal cell development 13 . Activation of RET occurs via oncogenic mutations in multiple sporadic carcinomas, most notably those of the thyroid and lungs 14 , 15 . Therapeutic approaches targeting RET with small-molecule kinase inhibitors are being evaluated for cancers that are associated with RET mutations or increased RET expression, such as MTC, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), and breast and pancreatic cancers 16 - 18 . Importantly, Bagheri-Yarmand et al. 19 reported that RET contributes to cancer cell viability via the direct repression of ATF4 at the promoters of pro-apoptotic targets NOXA and PUMA. Despite the well-documented pathogenic, diagnostic and prognostic roles of RET in MTC 20 , its precise role in BTZ-induced apoptotic cell death in OS remains unknown. ATF4 was also identified as a negative regulator of RET in MTC 12 . However, the mechanistic link between ATF4 and RET signalling in OS development are still unclear.
