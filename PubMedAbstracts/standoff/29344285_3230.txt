 Although loss of H19/IGF2 cluster imprinting could drive tumourigenesis 12 , 13 , a large share of the cancer-promoting effects of H19 is delivered via microRNA-675 (miR-675), a short noncoding RNA transcribed from the first exon of H19. MiR-675 has been demonstrated to be differentially expressed in many tumours. The levels of miR-675 are significantly increased in several cancer tissues such as glioma 14 , gastric cancer 10 , 15 , colorectal cancer 4 , non-small cell lung cancer 16 , hepatocellular cancer 17 , breast cancer 18 , 19 and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 20 . On the other hand, low miR-675 expression has also been observed in bile duct cancer tissue 21 . Liu et al. revealed that miR-675 could inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy 22 . The functional roles of miRNAs in tumourigenesis depend on the types of target genes. Liu et al. suggested that miR-675 overexpression promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation by targeting the tumour suppressor RUNX1 at the mRNA and protein levels 15 , whereas Wang et al. found that miR-675 could decrease the protein expression of ZEB1, which promoted the EMT process in pancreatic cancer 23 . To date, there are few studies on the correlation between miR-675 and PDAC. After examining formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PDAC tissue samples from 225 patients, Schultz et al. discovered five differentially expressed miRNAs, including increased level of miR-675 24 . Wang et al. reported that decreased miR-675-5p expression was associated with enhanced cell proliferation and patient survival in PDAC 23 .
