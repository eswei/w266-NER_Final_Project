 Other adipose-released factors could be useful for GDM prediction and detection. The fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been correlated with obesity markers, such as high BMI and fat mass, and regulate lipid and glucose metabolism through fatty acid transport and uptake [ 131 ]. The retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is a circulating retinol transporter that has been linked with cardiometabolic markers in inflammatory chronic diseases, including obesity, T2DM, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis [ 132 ]. Interestingly, high levels of FABP4 were proposed as a predictive biomarker of GDM from at the 1st and 3rd trimester of gestation [ 133 â€“ 135 ]. Also, an upregulation of plasma RBP4 at the 1st and 2nd trimester was modestly correlated with GDM risk, particularly among women with advanced age and obesity [ 115 , 136 ] (Table 3A). Finally, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is as a multi-functional cytokine with relevant implications in phosphate and vitamin-D metabolism. It also participates in cardiovascular disturbances, including atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy [ 137 , 138 ]. Notably, FGF-23 estimated adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women with T2DM [ 139 ], and also, high levels of FGF-23 (and low of adiponectin) diagnosed GDM at the 3rd trimester [ 140 ] (Table 4).ii.
