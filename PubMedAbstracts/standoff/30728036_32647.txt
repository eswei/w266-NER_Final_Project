 Mechanistically, LINC00346 can be negatively regulated by miR-188-3p. We found that overexpression of miR-188-3p significantly inhibits the expression of LINC00346 in pancreatic cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assay validated the presence of a functional response element specific for miR-188-3p in LINC00346. Biochemically, both LINC00346 and miR-188-3p were present in Ago2 immunoprecipitates. Moreover, LINC00346 and miR-188-3p were co-localized in pancreatic cancer cells. Although miR-188-3p has a pro-metastatic activity in colorectal cancer [ 30 ], an opposite effect is noted in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrate that overexpression of miR-188-3p causes growth reduction and enhances gemcitabine cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. Considering that LINC00346 and miR-188-3p exert opposite effects against pancreatic cancer cells, we hypothesized that the oncogenic activity of LINC00346 may be ascribed to the interaction with miR-188-3p. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that overexpression of LINC00346 reverses the growth-suppressive and chemosensitizing effects evoked by miR-188-3p. Clinical evidence further reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LINC00346 and miR-188-3p in pancreatic cancer specimens. Taken together, LINC00346 confers aggressive phenotype by sponging miR-188-3p.
