 In our study, although we were limited by the cross-sectional design that precludes making causal inferences or establishing the sequence of events, we found that, in the presence of infection with H. pylori, there was higher hepcidin levels, as would be expected. Likewise, we found that hepcidin levels were lower when iron stores were low, but this was statistically significant only when children were free of H. pylori infection. In contrast to what was found when the children had both conditions, H. pylori infection and iron deficiency, in these cases the hepcidin levels were higher. These results suggest that in children with H. pylori infection, the hepcidin synthesis is upregulated regardless of their iron status. Therefore, the stimulus to the synthesis of hepcidin due to H. pylori infection is greater than iron deficiency stimulus; in children with iron deficiency who have H. pylori infection, hepcidin levels are higher than those in children with iron deficiency without H. pylori infection. If the infection is prolonged, as is common in H. pylori infection, or the individual is malnourished, the hypoferremia caused by inflammation may produce or worsen the nutritional deficiency [ 25 ]. These results could indicate that in children with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia and H. pylori infection, it is necessary to treat the infection first and then determine whether it is still necessary to give iron supplements. Future studies are needed to understand the hierarchical nature of hepcidin production, including production under normal and pathological conditions, also to identify cut-off values that classify low, normal, or high hepcidin status. Likewise, more research is needed to explore if other chronic inflammatory processes besides H. pylori infection are associated with iron deficiency and high production of hepcidin.
