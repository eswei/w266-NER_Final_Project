 As we reported, only two DS participants out of 47 who carried the TREM2-C/T mutation, and a similar frequency was previously reported in the AD population [ 48 ]. One DS participant (D4, 39 years old) with TREM2 R47H (T allele) who was heterozygous for ApoE (ɛ3/ɛ4) slowly deteriorated and developed dementia, whereas another DS participant (D7, 37 years old) who was homozygous for ApoE (ɛ3/ɛ3) but had no clinical symptoms of dementia as yet. The ApoE ɛ2 allele has been associated with a decreased risk of AD [ 49 ]. The frequency of ɛ2 alleles in DS was higher (20%), and interestingly nearly all DS participants above 50 years of age who were either carrying ɛ3/ɛ3 or ɛ3/ɛ2 haplotypes were cognitively normal or developed dementia at a much later stage. There was a correlation between TREM2-T, HLA-DR-A, Tau-H1, and ApoE-ɛ4 (T-A-H1-ɛ4) and a high-risk of dementia in contrast to TREM2-C, HLA-DR-G, Tau-H2, and ApoE-ɛ2 haplotype, which was protective (C-G-H2-ɛ2).
