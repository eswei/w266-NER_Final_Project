 Aberrant O-glycosylation is a hallmark of metabolic disorders and many cancers. Altered cell-surface O-glycoproteins are often implicated in proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [ 29 ]. GALNTs were illustrated as the importance in cancer pathogenesis. The GALNT levels vary with cell type, differentiation, and malignant transformation [ 30 , 31 ]. GALNT12 mutation inactivated the normal function of the GALNT enzyme in initiating mucin type O-linked protein glycosylation in colon cancers [ 32 ]. MiRNA cluster controlled glycosylation by targeting GALNTs, responsible for initiating mucin-type O-linked glycosylation [ 33 ]. Aberrant glycosylation resulting from GALNT1 involved in melanoma [ 34 ], ovarian [ 35 ], and bladder cancers [ 36 ]. Overexpression of GALNT2 inhibited IGF-l-stimulated growth, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma cells [ 37 ]. GALNT3 was predicted as an independent prognostic factor in renal cell carcinomas [ 38 ], and GALNT6 was found to function in pancreatic cancer [ 39 ]. Upregulation of GALNT5 played a major role in hepatoblastoma progression [ 40 ]. GALNT7, as a downstream target of miR-34a, encoded GalNAc-transferase 7 to participate in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [ 13 ]. Several studies have reported the function of GALNT7 in the regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 41 ] and cervical cancer [ 14 ]. These findings suggested that genetic defects in the O-glycosylation in part underlied aberrant glycosylation in CRC. In our study, GALNT7 expression was increased in metastatic CRC cells and tumor tissues. Therefore, GALNT7 implicated as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC.
