 Many signaling pathways, such as transforming growth factor‐β/Smad, Wnt/β‐catenin and mitogen‐activated protein kinase, have been reported to regulate CRC metastasis 4. In addition to signaling pathways, the roles of non‐coding RNAs in CRC metastasis have also been intensively investigated. MiRNAs, a class of small, non‐coding RNAs, can bind to the 3′‐untranslated region (UTR) of target genes and regulate gene expression at the post‐transcriptional level 5. Recently, a number of groups have demonstrated abnormal miRNA expression in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and significant progress has been made in elucidating the specific roles of miRNAs in the initiation, progression and metastasis of CRC. For example, as a highly expressed onco‐miRNA in many cancers, including CRC, high miR‐21 expression is correlated with chemotherapy insensitivity and poor prognosis 10. MiR‐143 and miR‐145 can exert tumor‐suppressive functions and have low expression in CRC 13. MiR‐543 inhibited CRC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo by targeting KRAS, MTA1 and HMGA2 14. MiR‐34a‐5p suppresses metastasis and its expression predicts recurrence in patients with stage II/III CRC 15. Pro‐metastatic effects of miRNAs in CRC have also been reported. For example, miR‐625‐3p exerts its oncogenic functions in CRC metastasis by regulating the suppressor of cancer cell invasion/E‐cadherin/matrix metalloproteinase‐9 pathways 16.
