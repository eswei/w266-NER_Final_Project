 In addition, we obtained three DElncRNA–nearby target DEmRNA pairs, namely HCG25–KIFC1, LOC105378687–CDC20 and LOC101927043–EPCAM. KIFC1 was widely overexpressed in various cancers such as breast cancer, non‐small‐cell lung cancer and gastric cancer, and was reported to be involved with the development and prognosis of cancers 35, 36, 37. A recent study found that overexpressed KIFC1 was found in HCC and was associated with shorter overall survival time of patients with HCC 38. Upregulated KIFC1 was also found in HCC with both diagnostic and prognostic value for HCC in our study, which provided evidence in support of the previous study. There is no study report on the association between HCC and HCG25. KIFC1 was a nearby target gene of HCG25 and HCG25 was significantly upregulated in HCC and has great diagnostic value for HCC. We speculate that HCG25 may regulate the process of HCC by its cis‐regulatory role on the expression of KIFC1. As one of the key genes associated with the hepatocyte cell cycle, CDC20 has been reported to be involved with the development of HCC 39. Silencing CDC20 could delay hepatocellular mitotic progression and inhibit HCC cell proliferation 40, 41. In this study, both diagnostic and prognostic values of CDC20 for HCC were observed. EPCAM is a cell surface glycoprotein that serves as a marker of cancer stem cells. Upregulated EPCAM has been found in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Moreover, EPCAM was associated with shorter survival of patients with HCC. We speculate that LOC105378687 and LOC101927043 may play roles in the development of HCC by interacting with CDC20 and EPCAM, respectively.
