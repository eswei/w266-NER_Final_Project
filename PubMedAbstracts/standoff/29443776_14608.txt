 3.4 Predicted targets of the identified miRNAs There is strong evidence that the function of miRNAs mainly depend on their targets. Using the Gene Ontology and KEGG database, we identified that miR-141-3p and miR-1915-5p target genes include ZEB1, ZEB2, EIF4E, BAP1, CLOCK, CD133, and PAX2. The possible biological impacts of the differentially expressed miRNAs based on Gene Ontology are cellâ€“cell signaling, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell death. The KEGG pathways are enriched in some biological pathways, such as p53 signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase, WNT, and Chemokine signaling pathways (Fig. 3).

Pathway analysis was performed on genes predicted to be targets of differentially expressed miRNAs.
