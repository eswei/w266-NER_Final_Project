 Statistical Analysis HLA alleles were deduced into three loci haplotypes (DRB1-DQA1-DQB1) as described earlier ( 10 ). DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 haplotype was abbreviated as DR3-DQ2, DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 as DR7-DQ2 and DRB1*11/12–DQA1*05:05–DQB1*03:01 as DR5-DQ7. DRB1*04:01-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02, DRB1*04:02-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02, DRB1*04:04-DQA1* 03:01-DQB1*03:02, DRB1*04:05-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02, and DRB1*04:08-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:04 haplotypes were considered as DR4-DQ8. X was defined as non-DR3-DQ2 and non-DR4-DQ8 haplotype. HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1/DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 genotypes (combination of two DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotypes) were grouped into two HLA-risk categories encoded as low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) categorical variables by means of the known risk associated with T1D and CD in the Slovenian population. The heterozygous genotype DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 and genotype DR4-DQ8/ DR4-DQ8 were defined as HR for T1D ( 8 , 33 , 34 ). Since the HLA influence on CD susceptibility showed a dose effect, DR3-DQ2/ DR3-DQ2 and DR3-DQ2/ DR7-DQ2, which are DQB1*02 homozygous combinations were classified as high risk for CD ( 10 ). DR3-DQ2/X and DR4-DQ8/X single dose combinations, DRB1*07-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02/DRB1*11/12-DQA1*05:05-DQB1*03:01 haplotype combination with DQ2 alleles carried in trans as well as non-DQ2 and non-DQ8 (X/X) haplotype combinations were considered as low risk. For the description of continuous and categorical variables, median with interquartile range and frequencies were used, respectively. Standard chi square test was used to compare distribution of categorical clinical characteristics between different patient groups and to assess deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous clinical characteristics between different patient groups. Logistic regression was used for comparison of genotype frequencies, calculating odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), as well as for the analysis of interaction between polymorphisms. Two-tailed Fisher's exact test was used for comparisons of the frequencies of HLA deduced genotypes. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
