 In the studies examining the expression level of PANDAR, many reports showed that PANDAR was associated with the prognosis of cancers. For instance, Li et al found that PANDAR was upregulated in thyroid cancer tissue and cell lines, and it could be a promising therapeutic target and important biomarker for thyroid cancer. 28 Similarly, an article reported that the expression level of PANDAR in hepatocellular carcinoma was crucially associated with the size of tumor nodule, vascular invasion, and TNM stage. 29 Moreover, overexpression of PANDAR was relevant to the poorer survival and shorter recurrence duration for the disease in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and it could be recognized as a potential tumor biomarker and therapeutic target. 29 However, the effect of PANDAR expression on prognosis in blood malignancies remains poorly defined. Findings from our study demonstrated that high expression of PANDAR indicated a poor prognosis in AML patients. PANDAR expression level influenced CR rate, with the PANDARʰⁱᵍʰ group having lower CR rate in comparison to the PANDARˡᵒʷ group. Logistic regression analysis showed that PANDAR expression was an independent prognostic factor for CR. More importantly, Kaplan–Meier survival analyses clearly showed that patients with higher expression of PANDAR had a shorter OS than those patients with lower expression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed the increased PANDAR expression was an independent unfavorable risk factor in AML patients.
