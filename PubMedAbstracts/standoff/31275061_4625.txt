 A secretary protein, TIMP-2, is located at 17q25, which inhibits the proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) [ 19 ]. The genetic variations of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 are linked to low transcriptional activity and with the risk of several diseases [ 20 – 23 ]. TIMP-2 (-418G/C, 303G/A) polymorphisms are located in the promoter region and known to have an influence on the transcriptional activity and occurrence of the tumor [ 20 , 24 , 25 ]. Genetic variation of TIMP-2 is also associated with the risk of the malignant tumor and cancer [ 23 , 26 ]. TIMP-2 (-418G/C, 303G/A) polymorphisms and haplotype CGC were associated with the risk of gastric cancer and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [ 27 , 28 ]. The GT (TIMP-2 -418∗G/303∗T) haplotype was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.18-2.69, P = 0.006, Pc = 0.024) [ 29 ]. TIMP-2 -418GC genotype showed a protective effect against prostate cancer (32.6% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.037, OR = 0.346) [ 30 ]. Although no association of TIMP-2 gene polymorphisms with the increased risk of prostate cancer, cervical cancer, myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (CAD), and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) was reported [ 29 , 31 – 33 ]. However, genetic variation of TIMP-2 (-418G/C, 303G/A) gene in patients with and without HAND is still unknown. Hence, the present study is projected to evaluate the genetic variants of TIMP-2 (-418G/C and 303G/A) gene with the risk of HAND from Western India.
