 SNCA protein is one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD ³⁵ . We showed that ASOᴬ¹⁹ can target wild type and mutant hSNCA, indicating its applicability for both familial and sporadic PD. Moreover, reducing the level of SNCA expression is likely to protect against neuronal toxicities. We previously reported that reduction of SNCA expression enabled the survival of more TH-positive neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model rats ³⁶ . SNCA knockdown by shRNA attenuates the progression of motor deficits in rotenone-exposed rats ³⁷ , suggesting that reduction of SNCA expression might also be beneficial for PD. Benskey et al. reported that excessive reduction of SNCA within nigrostriatal neurons induced rapid up-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1) and resulted in the death of affected neurons ³⁸ . However, several studies have shown that normalization of overexpressed SNCA decreased neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and improved motor function in animal models ³⁷ , ³⁹ . These data imply that adequate downregulation of SNCA can prevent neurodegeneration with little disadvantages.
