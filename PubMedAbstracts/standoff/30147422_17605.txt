 Conversely, our study showed that G6PDH and 6PGDH were up-regulated along with increased or unchanged GR in the heart and lung of aged diabetic rats. This finding confirms our previous reports (Gök et al., 2016 ) and is consistent with reports of others showing that high glucose concentrations leads to overexpression of G6PD and augmented PPP activity in different cell types (Peiró et al., 2012). The overactivation of PPP may be linked with increased depletion of NADPH in these tissues due to chronic hyperglycemia via increased polyol pathway activity and upregulated aldose reductase (Kyselova et al., 2005 ). However, the long-term overactivation of PPP would favor the utilization of NADPH by NADPH oxidase and the excess of free radical generation would further contribute to exhausting GSH (Peiró et al., 2016 ). NADPH oxidase requires higher concentrations of NADPH to be active, as the Michaelis constant for this enzyme is five times higher than for glutathione reductase (Matsui et al., 2005 ). It has been known for many years that diabetic patients have a decreased tissue concentration of GSH and the defects in GSH-dependent antioxidant enzymatic activity have been related to diabetes-associated tissue complications (Özdemir et al., 2009 ; Raza et al., 2012 ). In this context, we recall the early reports indicating that some tissues are highly sensitive even to low levels of hyperglycemia and NADPH than other tissues (Chandrasena et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2010 ). It may be reasonable to explain the differences in enzymatic activities as the tissue’s responses to aged diabetes.
