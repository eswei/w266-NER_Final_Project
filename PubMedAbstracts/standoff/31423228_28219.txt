 Generally, miRNAs bind to a target mRNA at the 3′-UTR to promote target mRNA degradation or block target mRNA translation ( 6 , 7 ). Bioinformatics analysis predicted that SUZ12 may be a target of miR-362-5p. SUZ12 is a carcinogenic factor and a catalyst of migration and invasion in various cancer types ( 16 – 18 ). The expression of SUZ12 is significantly increased in GC tissues, and increased SUZ12 expression promotes GC cell proliferation and metastasis ( 16 ). Furthermore, SUZ12 is involved in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated promotion of cancer progression ( 34 ). However, whether SUZ12 is involved in the cisplatin resistance of GC cells is still unknown. To verify whether the cisplatin resistance induced by miR-362-5p was mediated through SUZ12, further experiments are required. The results of the present study demonstrated that the SUZ12 expression level in SGC7901/DDP cells was markedly higher compared with expression in SGC7901 cells and that knockdown of SUZ12 enhanced the cisplatin sensitivity of SGC7901/DDP cells. These results implied that SUZ12 may act as a promoter of cisplatin resistance in GC. Notably, a previous study has confirmed that SUZ12 acts as positive regulator for NF-κB signaling ( 20 ). The NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in anti-apoptosis, inflammation and immunity. The present study demonstrated that the NF-κB/p65 protein levels were significantly decreased following knockdown of SUZ12. Therefore, SUZ12 may inhibit the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of GC cells by increasing the expression of NF-κB/p65. Notably, SUZ12 protein expression was increased in SGC7901 cells transfected with miR-362-5p inhibitor. By contrast, the expression levels of SUZ12 protein were reduced in SGC7901/DDP cells with upregulated miR-362-5p expression. Therefore, SUZ12 may be a target of miR-362-5p in GC cells.
