 MicroRNAs (miRNAs, 18–24 nucleotides) are small non-coding RNAs that suppress the expression of targeted genes via binding to the 3-untranslated regions (3′UTRs) and regulate the progression of cancer [ 4 ]. Previously, we reported that as members of the miR-106b ∼ 25 cluster, miR25and miR93 were downregulated in colon cancer and the low expression of miR93/25 promoted the invasiveness and metastasis of colon cancer cells [ 5 ].Similarly, miR-106b-5p, also as the member of miR-106b ∼ 25 cluster, is overexpressed in various chemo/radioresistant cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and CRC. Furthermore, miR-106b-5p overexpression induces cell radioresistance via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways and p21 in colorectal cancer [ 6 ]. Moreover in ccRCC, characterized by exceptionally high resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, miR-106b-5p promotes renal cell carcinoma aggressiveness and stem-cell-like phenotype by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling [ 7 ]. In addition, miR-106b-5p was found to be upregulated in ccRCC patients, and by inhibiting the function of the TRIM8 protein, the tumor suppressor activity of p53 is prevented, thereby enhancing the N-Myc pathway [ 8 ]. Thus, the miR-106b-5p might exert a dual role as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene, thereby requiring further exploration of its roles in CRC.
