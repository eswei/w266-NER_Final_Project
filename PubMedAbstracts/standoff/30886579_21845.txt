 Accumulative evidence shows that ncRNAs play a very important regulatory role in tumor progression of HNSCC. For instance, lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was found to modulate the progression of HNSCC ( Sun et al., 2018 ). HNSCC samples showed significantly robust expression/activation of HOTAIR compared with normal squamous epithelium. Overexpression of HOTAIR promoted the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo ( Sun et al., 2018 ). In our ceRNA network, the high expression of the HOTAIR and HOTTIP are closely associated with 6 miRNAs (mir-301b, mir-193b, and mir-31 are upregulated, whilst mir-216a, mir-206, and mir-375 are downregulated). The highly homologous miRNA to hsa-mir-301b, hsa-miR-301a-3p, played a role in the emergence and development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by directly regulating the Smad4 ( Lu et al., 2015 ). MiR-193b was over-expressed in HNSCC cell lines. Knockdown of miR-193b in FaDu cancer cells substantially reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, along with suppressed tumor formation ( Lenarduzzi et al., 2013 ). HNSCC patients whose tumors expressed high levels of miR-193b experienced a lower disease-free survival compared to patients with low miR-193b expression ( Lenarduzzi et al., 2013 ). The miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors ( Liu et al., 2012 ), miR-31 also facilitate migration and invasion by targeting Numb in HNSCC cells ( Chou et al., 2018 ). miR-206 and miR-375 were down-regulated in HNSCC clinical specimens and cell lines ( Nohata et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2017 ), which is in agreement with our results. Finally, expression level of miR-216-5p in cervical cancer tissues was observably lower than that in corresponding normal tissues ( Zhu et al., 2018 ).
