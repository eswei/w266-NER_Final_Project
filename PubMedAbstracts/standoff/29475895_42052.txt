 Moreover, a significantly higher concentration of t-PA in patients with expression of Ki67 higher than 15% in relation to patients with Ki67 antigen below 14%, notwithstanding this relationship was obtained only in the study group without comorbidities. Ki67 is a proliferative activity marker applied as a marker of tumour aggressiveness and is in use to predict prognosis. Ki67 expression above 15% indicates a high mitotic index, being the percentage of cells that are in the mitosis phase, which in BrCa patients is an unfavourable factor. The potential of Ki67 expression demonstrates the tumour proliferation rate and correlates with the initiation, progression, metastasis and prognosis of BrCa [ 21 ]. t-PA leads to the development of metastasis through proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. It is known that t-PA induces proliferation in a wide variety of cell types [ 19 ], including BrCa cells. Furthermore, according to clinical classification of the tumour, a significantly higher concentration of t-PA in patients with pT2 BrCa in relation to pT1 cases was noted, which is in line with Baluka et al. [ 19 ]. They observed higher t-PA concentrations in tissue homogenates in pancreatic cancer depending on the T (TNM) stage [ 19 ]. Taken together, those observations can be negative indicators due to the fact that t-PA is involved not only in the dissolution of cross-linked plasma fibrin, but also in extravascular proteolysis and tissue remodelling resulting in a pro-angiogenic profile enabling tumour invasion, cancer cell migration and spreading. Additionally, t-PA may indicate on metastatic phenotype and increased proliferation of tumour cells. All of these alterations directly contribute to enhanced cancer growth and aggressiveness [ 19 ]. A higher level of t-PA is related to poor prognosis in patients with BrCa.
