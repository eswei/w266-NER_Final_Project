 Discussion Stroke is an important reason for human disability, suffering and death. A lot of studies showed acute local inflammation is the characteristic of ischemic damage [ 8 ]. Highly expressed inflammatory markers can affect the development of ischemic vascular disease. In the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis, inflammation plays an important role [ 9 ]. Atherosclerosis often leads to IS because of the inflammation of blood vessels. So pro-inflammatory genes are quite important in the development of IS [ 10 ]. IL-17 consists of 155 amino acids and its molecular weight is ∼20 kDa. IL-17 can regulate inflammatory responses in many tissues. It can induce inflammation-related genes, such as IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. IL-17 receptor family contains IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE. IL-17 can play a physiological role only after binding to the receptor, while IL-17R can be expressed in endothelial cells. IL-17 can combine with IL-17R to activate NF-κβ and P-38, which then enhance the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. Other studies have shown that IL-17 alone or combination with IL-1 and TNF-α can induce the synthesis of IL-6 and IL-8 in fibroblast-like synovial cells. IL-17C often acts on epithelial cells by secretion to enhance inflammatory cytokines levels, antimicrobial peptides and anti-apoptotic factors [ 11 ]. Studies have shown that respiratory epithelial cells can secrete IL-17C and promote the expression of human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2), CSF and S100A12 by autocrine and paracrine modes [ 6 , 12 ]. IL-17 can combined with its receptor to promote the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, while atherosclerosis is closely related with the occurrence of IS [ 13 ]. In our study, we used qRT-PCR to determine the relative mRNA levels of IL-17, IL-17RC, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF in serum samples from IS patients and the control healthy. Results showed the relative mRNA levels of IL-17, IL-17RC, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF in IS samples were significantly higher than those in the control, which indicated IS up-regulates IL-17 expression, which combined with IL-17RC to secret IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF. Western blotting further verified the increased protein expression of IL-17 and IL-17RC in IS. Therefore, we speculated IL-17RC gene polymorphism may be related with the development of IS. Results of PCR amplification showed IL-17RC rs376511 was evident in IS group compared with the control. The percent of rs376511 in IS patients was markedly higher than that in the control group, while IL-17RC in IS patients was less. So we speculated IL-17RC rs376511 may influence the treatment effect and prognosis of IS. Our research showed treatment on patients with IL-17RC was well, while treatment on rs376511 was poor. The treatment effect on patients with SNP was between the effect of IL-17RC and SNP. After follow-up visits for 3 years, we obtained the death percent of patients with rs376511 which was much higher than IL-17RC and SNP, and the recrudescence percent of patients with rs376511 was 37.3%, which was higher than that with IL-17RC (18.1%) and SNP (17.2%).
