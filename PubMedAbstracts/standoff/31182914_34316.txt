 As a major substrate of mTORC1, 4EBP1 plays an essential role in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and survival by controlling translation initiation of oncogenic mRNAs. The weak inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation has been reported to be involved in rapamycin resistance in certain cancer cells 33 . Choo et al. first reported that rapamycin differentially inhibits S6Ks and 4EBP1; specifically, rapamycin persistently represses p70S6K activity but only transiently attenuates 4EBP1 phosphorylation 34 . In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PIM2-mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylation contributes to the limited repression of rapamycin on cell survival 35 . In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), overexpressed GSK-3β leads to weak inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation by rapamycin and combination of GSK-3β inhibitor and rapamycin remarkably suppressed 4EBP1 phosphorylation and cell proliferation 36 . In breast cancer, the feedback activation of AKT is responsible for the limited inhibition of rapamycin on 4EBP1 phosphorylation and AKT inhibition dramatically enhances the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on 4EBP1 phosphorylation and cancer cell proliferation 16 . In contrast, we found that AKT only partially contributes to the re-phosphorylation of 4EBP1, since LY294002 the inhibitor of PI3K, upstream of AKT, exhibited the more potent role than MK2206 the AKT inhibitor in enhancing the repression of RAD001 on 4EBP1 phosphorylation. This observation suggested that there were other kinases acting as downstream of PI3K that mediated the re-phosphorylation of 4EBP1 induced by RAD001 in coordination with AKT. By taking advantage of phosphoproteomic analysis, we identified SGK3 as a potent kinase involved in the re-phosphorylation of 4EBP1 induced by RAD001.
