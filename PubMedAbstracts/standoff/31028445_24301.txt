 The lack of a relationship between MYC rearrangements and semiquantitative ¹⁸F-FDG PET metrics might have several causes. First, proliferation in DLBCL could be independent of MYC rearrangement. This would only partially explain the lack of relationship, since the median proliferation index (Ki-67 staining) of MYC⁺ DLBCL is universally high (> 90%) in contrast to the much broader range observed in MYC− DLBCL [ 29 ]. Second, overexpression of MYC via other mechanisms such as epigenetic pathways might explain increased glucose uptake in MYC FISH–negative DLBCL. This is supported by studies showing high MYC protein expression in 19–40% of DLBCL cases [ 30 – 32 ]. Cottereau et al previously reported a lack of relation between MYC protein expression and ¹⁸F-FDG PET parameters in DLBCL [ 19 ]. However, FISH analysis, which is considered the gold standard examination for MYC rearrangements [ 33 – 35 ], was not performed. Third, high metabolic activity might be induced by alternative changes in metabolic drivers, such as mutations in PTEN (observed in approximately 15% of DLBCL) that lead to activation of the P13K/AKT/mTOR pathway [ 29 , 36 – 38 ].
