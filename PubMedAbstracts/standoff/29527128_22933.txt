 Combinations of VEGFR-TKIs, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and HIF inhibitors may provide good options to overcome drug resistance. Increasing evidence supports a primary role for the HIF-2α subunit in ccRCC over HIF-1α. Due to the frequently VHL loss in ccRCC, which causes increased expression of HIFs, targeting HIFs may be a promising strategy for ccRCC because of frequent VHL loss, which increases HIF expression. HIFs are upstream of the crosstalk between growth factors and regulate the expression of VEGR, EGF, PDGF and other growth factors, which supports targeting HIFs to overcome TKI resistance. Recent preclinical and clinical data on ccRCC indicate that PT2385 and PT2399 effectively inhibit cancer cell growth, proliferation, and tumour angiogenesis characteristic [ 88 , 89 ]. The combination of HIF and immune checkpoint inhibitors is also anticipated, and various clinical trials for PD-1 inhibitors are planned.
