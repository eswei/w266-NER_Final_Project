 This research study did not indicate a significant impact of certain atherosclerosis complications (including coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries) and selected cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, LDL, and triglyceride concentrations) on the levels of t-PA and PAI-1. It was found that t-PA Ag and PAI-1 Ag values tended to rise along with BMI increase in the subgroups of subjects (with normal body mass, overweight, and obesity), though without statistically significant differences. However, significant positive correlations were found between t-PA Ag and BMI as well as between PAI-1 Ag and BMI. The analysis of available literature has shown that positive correlations of PAI-1 Ag and BMI concentrations were observed in patients after myocardial infarction and individuals with morbid obesity [ 13 , 14 ]. Alessi et al. explain this observation by the fact that adipose tissue in abdominal obesity is where synthesis of PAI-1 occurs [ 14 ]. No data were found about a positive correlation of t-PA Ag and BMI in the blood of both sick and healthy subjects. Indirect data, however, seem to suggest that between the concentration of t-PA Ag and BMI there is a negative correlation. This is supported by the research conducted by Abd El-Kader and Al-Jiffri, who evidenced that a low BMI in patients with simple obesity increased the levels of t-PA Ag and t-PA activity [ 15 ]. It is possible that in our research study a positive correlation of the concentration of t-PA Ag and BMI as well as PAI-1 Ag and BMI was associated with high plasma levels of PAI-1 Ag and reflects intensive formation of t-PA-PAI-1 complexes.
