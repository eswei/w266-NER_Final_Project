 The downregulation of miR-15a-5p has been identified in CKD with hypertension [ 35 , 36 ]. In addition, Ge et al suggested the downregulation of miR-16-5p, miR-15a-5p and miR-15b-5p in sepsis-induced AKI versus sepsis non AKI [ 27 ]. This consistency showed the important roles of these miRNAs in AKI. The difference is our present study identified lncRNAs related to these miRNAs. The expression of lncRNAs XIST and NEAT1 are significantly increased in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells, and urinary XIST serves as a potential marker for detecting membranous nephropathy [ 37 ]. Elevated XIST, which could be induced by LPS, is correlated with glomerular nephritis [ 37 ]. Our in vitro experiment using LPS-treated MPC5 cells showed XIST was elevated by LPS stimulus. We identified XIST regulated the expression of upregulated CUL3 by sponging the top 10 downregulated miRNAs, including miR-15a-5p, miR-16-5p and miR-107. The upregulation of CUL3 has been identified in patients with AKI [ 32 ]. Mutations in CUL3 reduced ubiquitination in the kidneys [ 38 , 39 ]. These studies indicated that XIST plays impressive roles in AKI via regulating CUL3 by sponging miRNAs. The miR-15a-5p-XIST-CUL3 regulatory axis in the ceRNA regulatory network was validated using the in vitro cellular experiment. We also demonstrated that miR-15a-5p inhibition reserved MPC5 cell apoptosis that was enhanced by XIST siRNA, so did as the overexpression of CUL3 for miR-15a-5p mimics-induced apoptosis in MPC5 cells. These data suggested that miR-15a-5p-XIST-CUL3 played crucial roles in sepsis-induced AKI, and the management targeting this axis might be of great value for controlling AKI development.
