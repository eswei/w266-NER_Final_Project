 The p450c17 enzyme is encoded by the CYP17A1 gene located on 10q24.3 (3) and spans 6.6 kb, which comprises eight exons (4). "This gene transcribes 2.1-kb mRNA molecule, which expresses in both the adrenals and gonads and generates a 57-kDa microsomal cytochrome P450c17 enzyme. The CYP17A1 enzyme catalyzes both steroid 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities" (5). Enzymatic failure of the P450c17 enzyme leads to both glucocorticoids and sex steroids deficiencies. After a reduction in blood glucocorticoids levels due to P450c17 defect, anterior pituitary tries to compensate for the insufficiency of glucocorticoids levels by producing extra Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This results in the extra generation of steroid precursors and elevated ACTH level, which leads to some Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and result in hypertension, hypokalemia, and a suppressed renin-angiotensin system (6, 7). Moreover, due to the impairments in CYP17A1, the mineralocorticoid precursors (corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone) accumulate, which demonstrate glucocorticoid activity, therefore defect in P450c17 does not associate with adrenal crisis, rather than other CAH variants (8). Mutations in the CYP17A1 gene are the rarest defects in CAH that yields to steroid 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase deficiencies (9). Several mutations in the CYP17 gene have been reported that cause either complete or combined17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase or isolated 17, 20-lyase enzyme deficiencies (10-14).
