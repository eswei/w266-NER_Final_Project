 Nevertheless, beyond being just a clinical marker for cardiovascular diseases, visfatin plays an important role in regulating vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. On the one hand, extracellular visfatin can promote proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells through a NAMPT-dependent mechanism [ 33 ]. On the other hand, growing scientific evidence supports that visfatin can promote the vascular inflammation through its immunomodulatory properties on different cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and immune cells [ 34 â€“ 37 ]. NAMPT has been reported to increase in inflammatory M1 macrophages compared to in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, suggesting that NAMPT could contribute to plaque inflammation in atherosclerotic disorders at least partly through its effect on macrophages [ 38 ]. In addition, Alexander et al. have also found that elevated level of visfatin was an independent predictor for declined numbers of non-classical endothelial progenitor cells in T2DM individuals [ 39 ]. Therefore, visfatin has emerged as a promising pharmacological target in the context of cardiovascular complications.
