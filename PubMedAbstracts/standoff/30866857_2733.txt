 Background β2M is a nonglycosylated protein with a molecular weight of 11.8 kDa. Its serum expression levels are elevated in cancer patients, including patients with breast cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and gastrointestinal cancers [ 1 – 9 ]. Previous studies have demonstrated that β2M enhances the growth and survival of cancer cells through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway and cell survival signaling, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways [ 10 – 13 ]. The β2M/hemochromatosis protein (HFE) complex could induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes bone and soft tissue metastases of human prostate, breast, lung, and renal cancer cells in vivo by activating the iron-responsive hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway [ 14 ], and β2M could promote tumor growth through the activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in ovarian cancer [ 15 ]. These findings suggest that β2M can promote tumor growth and metastases, including breast cancer, and the β2M-mediated multiple molecular signaling network is extremely complex.
