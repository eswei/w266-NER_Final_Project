 Studies have shown that Hg exposure had positive and negative associations with CVD. Positive associations between the levels of Hg in the hair or nails and increased cardiovascular risk have been reported in epidemiological studies [ 33 , 34 ]. One study reported that mercury in the blood may be associated with increased risk of hypertension and myocardial infarction or angina [ 12 ], but no association with stroke [ 12 ]. Another study among US health professionals found that no association existed between Hg level in nail and risk of coronary heart disease, stroke or cardiovascular disease [ 35 ]. By contrast, protective associations have been found between S-Hg levels and the risk of acute myocardial infarction [ 36 ] but not stroke [ 37 ] in prospective caseâ€“control studies from northern Sweden. In a cohort study of women with previously determined S-Hg in Gothenburg, Sweden, higher S-Hg levels predicted low mortality and a low risk of fatal AMI but had no predictive value for nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke [ 38 ]. In our study, both S-Hg and U-Hg had a significantly protective effect against stroke after adjustment for sex, age, hypertension, and other key demographic characteristics. Our study is the first to document the negative associations between the levels of S-Hg and U-Hg and stroke.
