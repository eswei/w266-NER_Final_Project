 To date, ADT remained as the standard therapy for men with de novo or recurrent metastatic disease 18 . Typically, ADT was able to reduce the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in 80-90% of patients during initial treatment. However, almost all patients virtually progressed to CRPC at a median of 18-24 months after diagnosis 19 . There was no curative therapy available for CRPC. In a large portion of castration-resistant tumors, an enhanced expression of the AR was detected, which could result in a reactivation of AR transcriptional activity despite low androgen levels. In 20-30% of CRPC tumors the enhanced AR expression was based on AR gene amplifications 20 , 21 . This study revealed that overexpression of 4-1BBL significantly augmented proliferation and invasion of androgen dependent PCa cells in androgen deprivation environment. Meanwhile, both expression of AR in prostate cancer cell lines and in PCa tumor bearing SCID mice were positively associated with overexpression of 4-1BBL. Furthermore, 4-1BBL mediated increase of proliferation and invasion abilities of LNCaP could be blocked by Enzalutamide, a specific AR signaling inhibition. Therefore, this study speculated that 4-1BBL might play a critical role in PCa progression to CRPC via enhancing AR function.
