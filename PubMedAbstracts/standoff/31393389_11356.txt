 In this meta-analysis, we also suggested a significant association between Mn levels and HCC. In serum, the Mn levels in HCC were significantly lower than in healthy controls. In tissue, the Mn levels in tumors were significantly lower than in adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, in the study by Yu et al, the serum Mn levels in HCC increased significantly after treatment (SMD (95% CI): −0.561 (−1.020, −0.103)), which also indicated an inverse association between Mn levels and HCC. In hair, the Mn levels in HCC were slightly lower than in healthy controls, but not significant, which might contribute to tissue specificity. Similarly, breast cancer patients had a higher nickel (Ni) level in serum (SMD: 1.76, 95% CI: 0.82–2.70), but it was not significant in hair (SMD: 0.16, 95% CI: −1.08 to 1.40).[ ³⁵ ] Breast cancer patients had a lower Zinc (Zn) level in hair (SMD: −1.99, 95% CI: −3.46 to −0.52), but it was not significant in serum (SMD: −0.65, 95% CI: −1.42 to 0.13).[ ³⁶ ] Nevertheless, Zinc supplementation could significantly increase natural killer T (NKT) cells, which were involved in the direct killing of target cells and thus provided anti-tumor protection.[ ³⁷ ]
