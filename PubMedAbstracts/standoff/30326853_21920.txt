 Erlotinib is known to be a substrate for adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters (ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC10) [ 17 ]. ABCG2 and ABCB1 are expressed not only in tumor tissues but also in normal tissues including the liver [ 18 ]. PPIs and H2-antagonists are ABCG2 and ABCB1 inhibitors, which increase the concentration of ABCG2 and ABCB1 substrates such as erlotinib in the liver, resulting in hepatotoxicity. In our previous study on gefitinib, co-administration of PPIs and H2-antagonists showed significantly increased hepatotoxicity in NSCLC patients [ 13 ]. Another study evaluated the genetic polymorphism of ABC transporters on erlotinib-related adverse effects [ 19 ]. While the results did not reinforce the association between hepatotoxicity and genetic polymorphisms, they suggested that ABCG2 34G > A was a useful predictor of skin rash of grade 2 or higher level. Further, patients carrying ABCG2 -15,622 T/T polymorphism and ABCG2 (1143C/T, -15622C/T) haplotype developed significantly higher frequency of grade 2/3 diarrhea [ 20 ]. Based on the genetic results, ABCG2 represents a candidate marker of erlotinib-induced adverse reactions including hepatotoxicity.
