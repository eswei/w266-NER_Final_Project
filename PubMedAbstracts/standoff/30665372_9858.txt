 In general, each specific mutation results in a syndrome with different clinical manifestations and organ involvements [ 4 ]. Figure 1 presents the secondary structure of ApoAI, based on the UNIPROT database (<url>) and pinpoints on this pattern the exact sites of identified mutations (<url>). For example, another already described mutation in the same genetic locus of APOA1 leads to Leu60Arg amino-acid substitution and has a totally different phenotype [ 16 ]. Leu60Pro variant is associated with deposition of amyloid fibrils in the liver without renal involvement while Leu60Arg has precipitated renal dysfunction without liver involvement [ 16 ]. This is not surprising since even for identical variants, multiple genetic and environmental factors may contribute to phenotypic variation [ 17 ]. Among known mutations, eight (including Gly26Arg, Trp50Arg, Leu60Arg, Leu64Pro, Glu70_Trp72del, Asn74fs, Leu75Pro, Ala154fs) have been associated with renal involvement (with or without liver involvement) [ 8 ] and only one with isolated liver involvement (Leu60_Phe71delinsValThr). According to the initial description of a Spanish family with AApoAI amyloidosis caused by heterozygous mutation Leu60_Phe71delinsValThr [ 18 , 19 ], the diagnosis was first made in two asymptomatic females after undergoing liver biopsies due to abnormal liver function tests during routine screening. Both cases were later found to suffer from primary adrenal insufficiency, which was confirmed by blood tests (high level of ACTH and low level of cortisol) at ages 65 and 66, respectively.

The sites of identified mutations, as provided by <url> are shown with red boxes. The L60P mutation described in the manuscript is also shown in red characters
