 DEGs in pretreatment tumors between non-responders and responders Pretreatment samples from 32 responders were first compared to those of 18 non-responders: 30 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed (Table 2). Twenty-three of these 30 DEGs were relatively overexpressed and 7 genes were relatively underexpressed in responding tumors. Tyrosine-sulfated secretory protein encoding gene CHGB, PTEN-related encoding gene TPTE, and G protein-coupled receptor encoding gene NMBR were significantly overexpressed in responders (FDR < 0.05). Intriguingly, CHGB, TPTE were upregulated after months of NET in responders, but not in non-responders. In contrast, potassium channel proteins encoding gene KCNK3 was overexpressed and upregulated after NET in non-responders.
