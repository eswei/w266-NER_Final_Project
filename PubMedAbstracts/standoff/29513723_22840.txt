 A recent study reported that the number of patients needing renal replacement therapy is increasing [ 36 ]. End-stage kidney disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; thus, it is important to detect a biomarker of both the renal outcome and mortality. In addition, cardiovascular disease is frequently associated with CKD, which is important, since individuals with CKD are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than to develop kidney failure. Indeed, the term “cardiorenal syndrome” has been increasingly used, and a new classification was proposed because a large proportion of patients admitted to hospital have various degrees of heart and kidney dysfunction [ 37 ]. As previously reported [ 13 , 18 , 19 ], the renal RI predicts the renal prognosis, cardiovascular events, and death in CKD patients. Moreover, the cystatin C concentration predicts all-cause and CVD mortality in patients with CKD [ 5 , 38 ], and cystatin C might be a biomarker of cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy [ 6 , 22 ]. Thus, once a patient is diagnosed with CKD, the measurement of both the RI and the serum cystatin C level appears to be useful for predicting the renal outcome, cardiovascular damage, and the risk of cardiovascular events. Our findings provide valuable insight into the relationship between the cystatin C level and a renal RI of 0.66 (the median level at which worse renal and cardiovascular outcomes are predicted [ 18 ]). We reported that the cystatin C level could predict this RI value in patients with a moderate degree of accuracy (AUC = 0.882, Cut off cystatin C value: 2.04mg/L). Incidentally, the AUC values of albuminuria and BNP for predicting this value (RI 0.66) were lower than the AUC of cystatin C.
