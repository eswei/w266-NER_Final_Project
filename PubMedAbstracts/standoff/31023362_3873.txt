 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are defined as a heterogeneous population of immature cells derived from myeloid progenitors, which confer immune-suppressive functions [ 6 ]. Murine MDSCs are characterized by the expression of cell surface makers CD11b and Gr-1, which can be sorted into CD11b⁺Ly6CˡᵒʷLy6G⁺ granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) and CD11b⁺Ly6C⁺Ly6G− monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) [ 6 , 7 ]. Some studies showed that MDSCs were involved in the disease course of SLE. The treatment of MDSCs derived from C57BL/6 mice reduced the levels of anti-dsDNA antibody in serum and proteinuria in the kidney in the lupus mice [roquin (san/san) mice] [ 8 ]. MDSCs inhibited the cytokine-mediated differentiation of naïve B cells into plasma cells and relieved the injuries of the kidney [ 9 ]. While other studies suggested that MDSCs were pro-inflammatory and could promote the disease progress in chronic inflammation conditions, Wu H et al. reported that the increased MDSCs in peripheral blood of patients are positively correlated with SLE and MDSCs promoted Th17 polarization by secreting Arg-1 in vitro [ 10 ]. In our previous research, we have found that MDSCs promoted Th17 polarization and inhibited Treg differentiation by IL-1β secretion to promote MRL/lpr lupus mice progress [ 11 ]. Meanwhile, we also found that MDSCs induced podocyte injury through increasing reactive oxygen species in lupus nephritis [ 12 ] and INK128 downregulated the expansion of MDSCs by inhibiting the mTOR pathway to relieve pristane-induced lupus development [ 13 ]. As is well known, MDSCs worked as regulators to monitor immune balance partly by the upregulation of ROS, Arg-1, and NO [ 14 ], but ROS also damaged proteins and nucleic acids and enhanced inflammation [ 15 ]. However, the involvement of MDSCs in LN progression is unclear.
