 It is well known that abnormalities in different types of lymphocytes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SLE, especially B cells [ 43 ]. A large body of evidence indicates that B cells are abnormal in SLE, with the increased number of cells, the elevated calcium flux on signaling through the B-cell receptor, and the high expression of co-stimulatory molecules on B cells [ 44 ]. Owing to its multiple pathogenic roles in SLE, understanding the proliferation of B cells is of importance. Cer has a variety of functions in the cell death process depending on its acyl chain length [ 45 ] Generally, a shift in Cer composition from C24 to C16 increases vulnerability to cell apoptosis [ 33 ]. Therefore, the altered compositions of Cer species may cause the proliferation of lymphocytes cells in SLE. IL-10 can induce mitochondrial hyperpolarization (that is, elevated mitochondrial transmembrane potential) resulting in increased reactive oxygen species [ 46 ]. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization was correlated with ATP reduction and necrosis of lupus T cells, which in turn may promote inflammation in patients with SLE [ 47 ]. So, the altered compositions of dPE species and of Cer species may have a close relationship with abnormal lymphocytes activation and cell death, which underlie the pathology of SLE. Certainly, further experiments are needed to demonstrate the conclusion.
