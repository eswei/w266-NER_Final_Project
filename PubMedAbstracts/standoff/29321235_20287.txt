 At the dementia stage, ¹⁸F-AV-1451 was superior to CSF tau biomarkers for AD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of CSF tau biomarkers may be confounded both by the physiologic between-person variability in CSF tau concentrations and by release of tau due to nonspecific neuronal injury. ²⁵ Another possibility that needs to be tested by longitudinal studies is that CSF tau may be more sensitive than ¹⁸F-AV-1451 to very early pathologic tau-related changes. For example, release of neuronal tau may be involved in interneuronal transmission of tau pathology, ²⁶ which hypothetically may occur before tau pathology is detected by ¹⁸F-AV-1451 imaging. Similarly, we have previously shown that CSF biomarkers may be more sensitive to Aβ pathology compared to PET imaging. ²⁷ The fact that CSF tau measures did not differ between prodromal AD and AD dementia suggests that these biomarkers plateau at the prodromal stage of the disease. In contrast, the ¹⁸F-AV-1451 signal was higher in the AD dementia than in the prodromal AD group, which likely reflects a continuous accumulation of tau as the disease progresses. One important difference between CSF and PET tau measurements is that ¹⁸F-AV-1451 makes it possible to track a potential spread of tau to new brain regions. Some regions may be affected later in the disease process (e.g., tau stage VI regions may be affected after tau stage V regions). This may explain why the latest stages show less separation between diagnostic groups than the earlier stages.
