 Various studies have demonstrated that miRNAs regulate liver insulin sensitivity. A study reported that in the livers of ob/ob mice or mice with HFD-induced obesity, the expression levels of miR-103 and miR-107 were significantly increased ( 35 ). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-103 and miR-107 in the livers of normal mice induced impaired glucose homeostasis, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, whereas inhibiting the expression of miR-103 and miR-107 improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. It has also been reported that caveolin-1, an important regulator of the insulin receptor, stabilised the insulin receptor in the cell membrane, and that overexpression of miR-103 and miR-107 inhibited caveolin-1 expression at the cell membrane, thereby inducing hepatic insulin resistance ( 35 ). Jordan et al ( 49 ) demonstrated that the levels of miR-143 expression were elevated in the livers of genetically altered or diet-induced models of insulin resistance. Overexpression of miR-143 was observed to result in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice, whereas inhibition of miR-143 expression improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity ( 43 ). MiR-215 is involved in the pathogenesis of various types of human malignant tumour ( 50 , 51 ); however, certain studies have reported the aberrant expression of miR-215 in fatty liver ( 36 , 37 ). The potential involvement of miR-215 in the development of T2D and fatty liver requires further investigation.
