 Increasing evidence has indicated that WWP1 is an underlying oncogene overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers. ¹⁵ , ¹⁸ Wang et al. ²⁷ recently revealed that WWP1-positive cells were increased in patients with prostate cancer compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, the integrated optical density value of WWP1 was markedly increased in patients with bone metastasis, compared with non-bone metastasis patients, as supported by real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that WWP1 plays a key role in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Elevated WWP1 mRNA and protein levels were also found in oral cancer patients and in six oral cancer cell lines, ¹⁷ suggesting that WWP1 also functions as an oncogene in oral cancer, and may thus may be a potential therapeutic molecular target for oral cancer. WWP1 was also shown to be overexpressed in a wide array of breast cancer cells. ¹⁶ Overall, these findings suggest that WWP1 may be a promising therapeutic molecular target in many types of tumors. We confirmed a potential role for WWP1 in CSCC by demonstrating that WWP1 expression levels were significantly increased in CSCC tissues and cells compared with normal tissues and immortalized human adult keratinocytes, as confirmed by sqRT-PCR and western blotting. In addition, high WWP1 levels were closely correlated with histological grade, invasion depth and lymph node metastasis. Notably, high WWP1 expression predicted a higher metastatic potential and poor prognosis in patients with CSCC, which differed from the results of a previous study in breast cancer patients, ¹⁶ but was consistent with a study in patients with gastric carcinoma. ¹³ These findings imply that WWP1 may represent a new biomarker for metastasis and prognosis in patients with CSCC.
