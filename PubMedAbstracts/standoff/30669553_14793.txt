 Here, we have presented the rationale for investigating the novel roles of microRNA-4719 and microRNA-6756-5p in respect to Interleukin-24 (IL-24) in PCa. The miRNA mechanisms regulating IL-24 mRNA or protein levels have not been fully delineated in the progression of PCa. When overexpressed, IL-24 kills PCa cells through several pathways. IL-24 can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species production, and calcium mobilization leading to apoptosis in PCa cell lines [ 12 ]. IL-24 can also downregulate anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and produce of tumor-suppressing ceramides leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and apoptosis in PCa [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 36 ]. In mouse PCa xenografts, IL-24 decreases the levels of secreted soluble clusterin (sCLU) protein, which is linked to resistance to chemotherapy and radiation and hormone therapies, leading to reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis [ 37 ]. Supporting these studies, IL-24 has been found to reduce factors of stemness such as migration, invasion, colony formation and inhibit the expression of SOX2 transcription factor, CD44 cell-surface glycoprotein and ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member 2 (ABCG2) compared to other cytokines, IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 in PCa cells [ 26 ]. In combination with ionizing radiation, IL-24 is also able to induce apoptosis in PCa cells overexpressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins that would normally exhibit resistance to IL-24 treatment alone [ 17 ]. Combination treatment of Sabutoclax, an inhibitor of prosurvival myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl-1) protein, with IL-24 also sensitizes prostate cancer tumors to IL-24-mediated apoptosis [ 18 ].
