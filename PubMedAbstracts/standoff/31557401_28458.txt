 In the present study, we identified another lncRNA LINC01133 and founded that its expression was significantly reduced in breast cancer tissues compared with those in the corresponding non‐cancerous tissues. Down‐regulated LINC01133 expression was remarkably associated with progression and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Moreover, down‐regulated expression of LINC01133 can be regarded as an independent prognostic indicator for breast cancer patients. These data implied that LINC01133 may have a critical role in the breast cancer progression. Previous studies have reported that LINC01133 was down‐regulated in colorectal cancer.13, 14 However, Zang et al15 reported that LINC01133 was upregulated in non‐small cell lung cancer. These findings are probably because lncRNAs exhibit a more remarkably tissue‐specific expression pattern than protein‐coding genes.27, 28 And, these data also indicated that LINC01133 had such tissue‐specific expression pattern. To further explore the role of LINC01133 in breast cancer, loss of function assays was performed and found that LINC01133 could promote breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and facilitate breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Conversely, the overexpression of LIC01133 can impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. These data indicated that LINC01133 may function as anti‐oncogene and might play vital biological role in the development of breast cancer.
