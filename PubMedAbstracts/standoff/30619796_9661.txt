 Discussion Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase δ Phosphoinositide-3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) is a heterodimer comprised of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta isoform (p110δ) and a p85 family regulatory subunit. PI3Kδ is present predominantly in leukocytes and plays an important role in leukocyte proliferation, activation, and survival ( 2 ). Its catalytic subunit p110δ is encoded by the PIK3CD gene. Immunodeficiency caused by activating mutations in PI3KCD are referred to by the names activated phosphoionositide-3 kinase delta syndrome (APDS) and p110δ activating mutation causing senescent T-cells, lymphadenopathy and immunodeficiency (PASLI) ( 5 ). The GLU1021LYS (E1021K) mutation in the catalytic subunit results in a gain of function and is the most common mutation found in this disorder ( 1 , 2 , 5 ). Other described mutations that lead to APDS are ASN334LYS (N334K), GLU525LYS (E525K), and CYS416ARG (C416R) ( 2 – 5 ). This condition has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and these mutations enhance membrane association, PIP3 production, and PI3K-Akt pathway activation as well as excessive activation of mTOR ( 2 , 5 ). Subsequently it was found that PI3Kδ activation also results from splice site mutations of the PIK3R1 gene which encodes for the p85α subunit. Binding of p85α subunit to p110δ inhibits its activity ( 7 , 8 ). These patients have a similar immunological phenotype to those with PIK3CD mutations but have more systemic features including neurodevelopmental delay, growth retardation, and autoimmunity ( 7 , 8 ). These disorders are termed APDS 2 (activated phosphoinositol kinase delta syndrome, type 2 (P85 mutations) or PASLI-R1 (OMIM 616005) ( 7 , 8 ). Other mutations, for instance ones that cause hyper-IgM syndrome, also result in similar clinical phenotypes and lab findings of low IgA and IgG but normal/elevated IgM. As in our case, when CD40/CD40L and AID/UNG testing are unrevealing in a patient with immune deficiency, normal/elevated IgM, recurrent infections, and lymphadenopathy, activating PI3Kδ mutations should be considered ( 3 , 5 ).
