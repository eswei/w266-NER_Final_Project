 In this study, we selected seven adipocytokine signaling pathway genes, including three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway genes [angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), and apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5)], leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1), and 5â€™-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1 (PRKAG1). PPAR or adipocytokine signaling pathway genes have been reported to be significantly upregulated in ruptured plaques (5). Of the remaining lipid-related genes, angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) is a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, which can regulate the activity of lipoprotein lipase in the lipolytic processing of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (6). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) regulates plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (7-9). Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) and paraoxonase 3 (PON3) are antioxidants against atherosclerosis (10). Very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) can affect the metabolism of VLDL-TGs, which are associated with CHD (11). MLX-interacting protein-like (MLXIPL) gene encodes carbohydrate response element-binding protein that has been found to be significantly associated with CHD (12). Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1) can regulate the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and thus might influence CHD incidence (13). Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been shown to increase the risk of CHD by disrupting the balance of HDL-C and LDL-cholesterol levels in the plasma (14). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) can reduce blood cholesterol levels and is associated with CHD (15). Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2B (PPAP2B), which catalyzes phosphoric acid hydrolysis and thus contributes to glycerophospholipid and triacylglycerol syntheses, has been shown to be associated with CHD (16, 17).
