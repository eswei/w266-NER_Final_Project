 D₂ dopamine receptor is involved in memory consolidation and memory retention ( Lénárd et al., 2017 ). Impaired D₂ dopamine receptor function is also associated with decreased physical activity ( Klinker et al., 2013 ). Decrease dopamine level was closely associated with increased D₂ dopamine receptor expression in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder rats ( Ko et al., 2013 ). Swimming exercise improved attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms by up-regulation of dopamine level and down-regulation of D₂ dopamine receptor expression in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder rats ( Ko et al., 2013 ). Genetic variations of D₂ might be associated with memory and attention tasks following mild TBI ( McAllister et al., 2005 ). In the present study, the expressions of D₂ dopamine receptor in the PFC, striatum, hippocampus, and SN were increased following TBI. Increased D₂ dopamine receptor in the TBI rats might be considered as the compensatory mechanism for the reduced dopamine level caused by TBI. In contrast, treadmill exercise suppressed the D₂ dopamine receptor expressions in the PFC, striatum, hippocampus, and SN of TBI rats. The suppressive effect of treadmill exercise on D₂ dopamine receptor expression may be related to an improvement in memory functions of TBI rats.
