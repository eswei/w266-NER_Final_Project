 The roles of miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p and miR-5100 in cancer progression have been reported. miR-193a-3p was demonstrated to suppress the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells and colorectal adenocarcinoma cells by targeting K-ras [ 38 , 39 ]. miRNA-193a-3p inhibits tumor proliferation migration and chemoresistance in human gastric cancer by regulating the PTEN gene [ 40 ]. On the other hand, the level of miR-193a-3p was significantly increased in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues and cell lines. miR-193a-3p increases cell proliferation and migration of RCC cells by targeting the ST3GalIV via PI3K/Akt pathway [ 41 ]. Lower expression of miR-193-3p is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, but better prognosis in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) [ 42 , 43 ]. Similar to the controversial roles of miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p was also suggested to have oncogenic or tumor suppression effects on the development of cancer, depending on the target [ 44 â€“ 46 ]. A higher level of serum miR-210-3p has been detected in people who live in a high-altitude hypoxic environment [ 47 ]. A high level of miR-210-3p in urine was also detected in RCC patients [ 48 ]. In this study, we found that cellular expression of specific miRNAs were decreased when these miRNAs were enriched in exosomes, suggesting the differential effects of miRNAs inside and outside of the cells.
