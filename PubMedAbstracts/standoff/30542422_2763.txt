 Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are a class of endo-genous, non-coding small molecule RNA, which regulate the expression of target genes by inhibiting or promoting the lysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) through specific translation of sequences, resulting in the different impacts of biological behavior of tumors ( 6 ). Many studies have found that miRNA is expressed in other cancers and diseases. miRNA-141 (miR-141), a member of the miRNA-200 family, plays an important role in the occurrence, development and physiological status of diseases by regulating different signaling pathways ( 7 ). Research has shown that ( 8 ) miR-141 is closely related to tumor and angiogenesis. In the study of Liu et al ( 9 ), through the analysis of 7 GEO chips, it was found that miR-141 was differentially expressed in the tissues of liver cancer patients. miRNA-183 (miR-183), located on human 7q32.2 chromosome, is one of the most important members of the miR-183 family. In addition, research has shown that miR-183 is closely related to tumor occurrence and recurrence ( 10 ). The study of Fan et al ( 11 ) has shown that the differential expression of miR-183 in breast cancer patients was found through the analysis of GEO (GSE39093) chip. However, it is not clear whether miR-141, miR-183 and IAAA are related. Some studies have shown that ( 12 , 13 ) miR-183 and miR-141 are highly expressed in TB patients, while TB bacillus, as the main pathogenic microorganism of IAAA, has not been reported in relevant studies before. The relationship between miR-183, miR-141 and clinicopathological characteristics as well as follow-up data were studied by detecting the expression levels of miR-141 and miR-183 in IAAA to explore whether miR-183 and miR-141 were potential risk factors for the poor prognosis of patients with IAAA.
