 Increased sAPPα in autism could be a neuroinflammatory response with resultant upregulation of the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Bailey et al. ( 23 ) demonstrated increased sAPPα, neuroinflammatory GFAP and gliosis in transgenic mice designed to overexpress sAPPα in brain tissue. Upregulation of GFAP was correlated with elevations in Interleukin 6 (IL-6), gp130, and Notch1. The IL-6/gp130 pathway is considered anabolic and promotes axonal sprouting of neurons and activated astrocytes after entorhinal cortex lesion in rats ( 197 ). Furthermore, ADAM17 participates in the cleavage of inflammatory factors related to microglial activation ( 113 ) and in reaction to injury ( 118 ). A prenatal insult would also increase the expression of NMDA and glutamate receptors in the offspring. High glutamate receptors activate the ERK signaling cascade. Zeidan-Chulia et al. ( 198 ) proposed this model for autism after performing a focused microarray analysis of genes belonging to NOTCH, WNT and AD. They found upregulation of glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 1 (GRIN1), and MAP3K1, which activates the JNK and ERK pathways. Among their conclusions, they proposed that epigenetic stress could lead to increased NMDA receptors and increased calcium that would stimulate ERK-dependent α-secretase activity. Activation of ADAM17 by ERK (and P38 MAP kinase), for example, can activate EGF receptor signaling which leads to enhanced cell proliferation ( 152 , 153 ). Higher levels of sAPPα would then activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway also resulting in aberrant brain growth. This model applies to brain cells in general, not just white matter. However, as described above, mTOR pathways favors myelination, except for the findings that disruption of upper mTOR pathways result in hypomyelination instead of hypermyelination ( 123 ). Therefore, other pathways such as activation of ERK1/2 may be needed to explain increased white matter in autism (Figure 1).
