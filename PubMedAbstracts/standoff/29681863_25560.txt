 The efflux of free cholesterol from cells mediated by ABCA1 is the early step in reverse cholesterol transport, and ABCA1 promotes the solubilization of lipids and their release (Hassan et al., 2008 ). A molecular defect in the ABCA1 gene is the cause of Tangier disease, which leads to premature atherosclerosis, proteinuria, and HDL deficiency (Schaefer et al., 2010 ). Additionally, ABCA1 genetic variants are strongly associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (Willer et al., 2008 ). In patients with DN, the increased cholesterol accumulation was associated with ABCA1 downregulation in kidneys (Herman-Edelstein et al., 2014 ). In type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE−/−) mice, the expression ABCA1 was downregulated in the kidney (Kruit et al., 2012 ; Yin et al., 2016 ). Our in vivo data demonstrated that the expression ABCA1 was downregulated in the kidneys of db/db mice, and treatment with TSF significantly decreased renal cholesterol levels and upregulated the expression of ABCA1. Silencing ABCA1 significantly suppressed the inhibitory effect of TSF on PA-induced total cholesterol levels in mTECs. Thus, we hypothesized that the ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux might play a major role in renal cholesterol accumulation that occurs in DN.
