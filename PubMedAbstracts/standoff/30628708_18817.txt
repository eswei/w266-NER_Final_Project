 The human ADH4 enzyme is encoded by the ADH4 gene, which maps to 4q22 within the ADH gene cluster ( 29 ). Previous studies have revealed that a ADH4 gene variant confers risk for alcohol dependence (AD) and related traits in European Americans and African Americans ( 29 ). Edenberg et al ( 30 ) reported that 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of ADH4, including rs2226896, are associated with AD, in an independent collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism. Edenberg et al ( 31 ) showed that ADH4 promoter variant âˆ’75A/C (rs800759), which could alter ADH4 enzyme expression levels significantly, as well as the 159A/G variant were significantly linked to AD in European Americans and African Americans in a Brazilian population ( 31 ). Previous studies have reported that ADH4 may be associated with cluster headaches and personality traits such as agreeableness and extraversion ( 32 , 33 ). In addition, polymorphisms in the ADH4 gene are associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer ( 34 ) and an increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancer ( 35 ), which suggests that the ADH4 may be involved in tumorigenesis. Wei et al ( 36 ) found that ADH4 mRNA expression in HCC is significantly lower than that in non-cancerous tissue, and ADH4 protein expression is also reduced in HCC, which indicates that ADH4 may serve as a tumor suppressor. These findings are consistent with the results of the present study, where ADH4 was identified as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC.
