 Neurological defects, including microcephaly, ataxia or neurodegeneration, are a hallmark for autosomal recessive mutations in individual genes encoding components of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex. Mutations in the NBS1 encoding gene, NBN, are associated with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) (OMIM# 251260) characterized by microcephaly, immunodeficiency, growth and intellectual disability, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. ¹ – ³ Mutations in RAD50 gene RAD50 are related to NBS-like disorder (NBSLD) (OMIM# 613078). ⁴ The clinical features of patients with NBSLD are very similar to those with NBN, including microcephaly and intellectual disability but not infections, immunodeficiency, or cancer predisposition. Mutations in MRE11A homolog, double-strand break repair nuclease gene MRE11 are associated with a very rare chromosomal breakage syndrome (OMIM# 604391). The clinical features are characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration and ionizing radiation hypersensitivity, similar to the ataxia telangiectasia (OMIM# 208900) caused by mutations in ATM, encoding ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). ⁵ , ⁶ The neurologic features have a later onset, slower progression and it is referred to as ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) (OMIM# 604391). ⁵ , ⁷ , ⁸ Unlike patients with ataxia telangiectasia, however, patients with ATLD show no telangiectasia or obvious immunodeficiency. ⁷ – ⁹ In 1999, first association of ATLD with mutations in MRE11 was reported, ⁵ followed by additional families with clinical features of ATLD ⁹ – ¹⁶ or NBSLD. ¹⁷
