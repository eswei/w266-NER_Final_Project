 Susceptibility markers: In our search for CML susceptibility markers, we observed rs17878951 and rs137863146 in HLA-DRB1 (Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II, DR Beta1) and HLA-DRB5 in our cohort. Both of the genes are participants of Interferon-gamma and CXCR4 signaling and play a key role in antigen presentation. Variants of HLA-DRB1 were found to be associated with incidence of CML in different populations throughout the world ( 28 – 32 ), and overexpression of HLA-DRB5 is a potential susceptibility marker of Lung cancer ( 33 ), whereas the genetic variants are markers for CLL ( 34 ) and breast cancer ( 35 ). Another variant (rs193179333) of RHPN2 (Rhophilin Rho GTPase Binding Protein 2) gene, which codes for Ras Homologous (Rho)-GTPase binding protein, was observed in 10 CML patients of our cohort. The RHPN2 binds to GDP and GTP bound RhoA and RhoB, involved in organization of actin cytoskeleton. Mutations of RHNP2 are linked with suspicion of colorectal cancer incidence ( 36 ), prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma and malignant glioma ( 37 , 38 ). The polymorphism of CYP2F1 (Cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily F member 1) gene is linked to lung cancer in different ethnicities ( 39 ), whereas differential expression are associated with prognosis of ovarian and breast cancer ( 40 – 42 ). In this study, rs117958555 was found in the majority of CML patients, which hints at being a susceptibility marker. In normal circumstances, it is involved in drug metabolism, hence genetic change in the gene can be possibly related to pathogenesis of CML. However, FUT3 (Fucosyltransferase 3) is involved in embryogenesis, tissue differentiation, tumor metastasiss and inflammation. Incidences of gastro-intestinal and breast cancer are linked to FUT3 genetic variations ( 43 , 44 ). Similarly, we also discovered rs151218854 in FUT3 related to incidence of CML. We also observed another mutation rs76684759 in KCNJ12 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily J Member 12), Normal KCNJ12 gene is involved in cardiac inward rectifier current (IK1). Its association with any type of cancer is not reported to the best of our knowledge, but we observed rs76684759 in more than 70% of our patients. The mutation is present in conserved region (SIFT Score: 0) and highly damaging (Polyphan : 0.999).
