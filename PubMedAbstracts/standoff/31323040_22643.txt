 Numerous studies have observed dysregulation of MCM1–10 in multiple cancers, and serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers. Previous reports showed increased expression of MCM2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues could be adopted as diagnostic biomarker.[ 28 ]The MCM3 immune-histochemical staining can be adopted as biomarker for oral squamous cell carcinoma early detection.[ 29 ] MCM4 has been opined to participate in the tumorigenesis of esophageal cancer.[ 30 , 31 ]Different cancers like pancreaticobiliary malignancy (PBC), [ 32 , 33 ]esophageal cancer [ 11 ]and cervical cancer (CC)[ 34 ] have been studied in the light of MCM5 as a diagnostic marker. MCM6 may serve as potential biomarkers in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)[ 22 ]. In addition, MCM7 has been helpful in early detection of gastric cancer (GC) [ 35 ], and altered diagnosis between malignant mesothelioma (MMCS) and reactive mesothelial cells (MCS)[ 36 ]. Deregulation of MCM2–7 can be potential biomarkers in meningioma tumor tissues[ 37 ].Consistent with the previous findings, our present work observed deregulations of MCM1–10 genes in LUAD cancer tissues which can be serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers.
