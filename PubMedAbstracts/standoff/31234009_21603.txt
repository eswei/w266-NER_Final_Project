 The lncRNA UCA1 is generally regarded as an oncogene, and it is usually highly expressed in a variety of cancers, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma, ¹⁰ melanoma, ¹¹ gastric cancer, ¹² and breast cancer. ¹³ In agreement with these studies, we found that UCA1 overexpression contributed to ovarian cancer cells’ cisplatin resistance. Upregulated UCA1 expression was observed in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer patients compared with that in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer patients. To further validate the relationship between UCA1 expression level and cisplatin resistance, we performed loss-of-function studies by knocking down UCA1 in two cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780-DDP and SKOV-3-DDP. Meanwhile, we upregulated the UCA1 expression in cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cells by establishing UCA1-overexpressing cell lines. Suppression of UCA1 significantly reduced cell growth and promoted cell apoptosis of cisplatin-resistant cells in the presence of 4 μg/mL cisplatin, compared with NC-transfected cells. However, UCA1 overexpression promoted the cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis and cell mobility of cisplatin-sensitive cells under cisplatin treatment.
