 The mechanism by which IgAVN was exacerbated by bevacizumab or how bevacizumab transforms IgAN into IgAVN is unknown. Hyperpermeability of the intestinal mucosa caused by bevacizumab has been reported, indicating excessive IgA secretion and involvement in the onset of IgAN.[ ² ] Gd-IgA1 contributes to the pathogenesis of IgAVN,[ ⁶ ] but its role in causing vasculitis is still under investigation. IgA and anti-epithelial cell antibodies (AECA) bind to the vascular endothelium and promote the migration and activation of neutrophils; this has also been pointed out as one of the causes for the onset of IgAVN.[ ¹³ ] Recent investigations have demonstrated that the concentration of AECA decreases in patients receiving bevacizumab.[ ¹⁴ ] Moreover, high expression of VEGF was reported in patients with vasculitis and in children with acute-phase IgAV.[ ¹⁵ , ¹⁶ ] Some reports suggest that bevacizumab administration is unlikely to lead to the development of IgAVN. However, there are reports of bevacizumab inducing the onset of periaortitis and leading to an increase in the rate of thrombosis.[ ¹⁷ , ¹⁸ ] Vascular disease is caused by an imbalance between vascular injury and epithelial repair. Endothelial progenitor cells are recruited by angiogenic cytokines, especially VEGF, and are essential for epithelial repair.[ ¹⁹ ] Murakami et al postulated that the inability to mobilize endothelial progenitor cells due to the presence of anti-VEGF antibodies is a risk factor for the development of vascular disease, thereby highlighting the possibility of exacerbating chemotherapy-induced vascular damage.[ ¹⁷ ]
