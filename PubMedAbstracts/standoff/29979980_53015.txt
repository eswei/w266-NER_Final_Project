 Although the novel disease caused by FARSB mutations described here shares some similarities with other known aaRS disorders, it is unique in other ways. None of the known aaRS diseases have extensive vascular and multi-organ manifestations, involving the lungs, brain, liver, kidney, intestine, and vasculature. However, other diseases caused by mutations encoding both non-polar and hydrophobic amino acid aaRSs share some clinical aspects with our FARSB individuals. For instance, recessive mutations in MARS (encoding methionyl-tRNA synthetase) (MIM: <url>) are associated with hypotonia, endocrine dysfunction, liver disease characterized by lobular disarray, canalicular cholestasis, steatosis, and iron deposition. ²⁵ Of interest, individuals with MARS mutations share with all five participants described here an extremely rare interstitial lung disease defined by cholesterol pneumonitis. 32 , 52 Autosomal-recessive IARS (encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase) (MIM: <url>) deficiency is associated with liver disease, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. 23 , 24 In contrast to our findings with deficiency of cytoplasmic FARSB, compound heterozygous mutations in nuclear-encoded FARS2 (the mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase) lead to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency associated with global developmental delay, refractory seizures, and lactic acidosis. ⁵³ Interestingly, in three individuals (P1, P3, and P5) a mitochondrial disease was suspected clinically. In P5, complex I activity was decreased, an observation similar to individuals with mutations in IARS. ²³ FARS, MARS, and IARS are part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic aaRSs and three aaRS-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3. 2 , 3 , 54 Some aspects of the clinical phenotype may be related to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC.
