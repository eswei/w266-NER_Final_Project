 A neuroprotective response of astrocytes subjected to 8 h treatment with NMDA was reported by Jimenez-Blasco et al., (2015) [ 48 ]. In this study, stimulation with NMDA of individual astrocytes derived from astrocytic-neuronal co-cultures resulted in calcium release from astrocytic ER, pointing to a metabotropic mechanism of NMDAR activation. The downstream sequence of events commenced with activation of protein kinase Cδ. Active protein kinase Cδ promoted formation of p35/cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) complex that further mediated nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) translocation to the nucleus and induced the expression of antioxidant genes (glutamate-cysteine ligase, hemeoxygenase-1, NADPH quinone oxidorreductase-1) and synthesis of glutathione (GSH). The newly synthesised GSH was then transferred to the neurons, which normally have a limited ability to synthesize this antioxidant. The results are interpreted to mimic the mechanism by which astrocytes protect neurons against oxidative stress.
