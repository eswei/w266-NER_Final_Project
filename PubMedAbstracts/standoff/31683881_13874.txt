 For the last decade, several trials to raise HDL-C concentrations pharmacologically by inhibiting the cholesteryl ester transfer protein were mostly unsuccessful in the prevention of CVD [ 13 , 14 , 15 ], suggesting that some factors beyond HDL-C concentration per se may be responsible for the increased risks of CVD. In the current results, the underlying mechanism between extremely high HDL-C and impaired glucose metabolism, a well-known risk for CVD, remains unknown, although participants with extremely high HDL-C levels had favorable profiles for weight, lipids, exercise, and smoking. Likely contributors to the observed associations can include rare dysfunctional HDL-C that exerts an impairing glucose metabolism, if any, and other factors, such as genetic factors (CETP, APOA1, LCAT, and so on) [ 4 ], and impaired hormones relating to glucose metabolism, such as reduced insulin secretion and increased counterregulatory hormones (adrenaline, glucagon, thyroid hormones, growth hormone, and cortisol, among others). Particularly concerning adrenaline, a catecholamine hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla, Okamura et al. [ 16 ] have shown that BMI was significantly increased, and serum HbA‚ÇÅc and HDL-C were decreased after an adrenalectomy in patients with pheochromocytoma. Similar findings were observed after treatment of pheochromocytoma in another study by Bosanska et al. [ 17 ], albeit a significant reduction in HDL-C was not observed. Moreover, it is possible that an elevated HDL-C in patients with pheochromocytoma could be considered an indirect effect of catecholamines-induced thermogenic activation of adipocytes [ 18 , 19 ].
