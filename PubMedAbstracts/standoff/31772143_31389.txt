 Last but not least, hsa_circ_0000515 acts as a sponge of miR-326 to upregulate ELK1. A more recent study identified miR-326 as a tumor suppressor in human prostatic cancer through inhibiting Mucin1 [ 35 ]. ELK1 triggers a proto-oncogene c-Fos, downstream target, by which ELK1 stimulates the growth of bladder cancer cells [ 36 ]. In line with our data that ELK1 over-expression promoted cervical cancer development, ELK1 is also able to inhibit the suppressive effects of Tanshinone I on proliferation of HeLa cells [ 37 ]. Inhibition of ELK1 is capable of suppressing thyroid cancer progression [ 38 ]. Down-regulation of ELK1 is responsible for the oncogenic role of tumor-suppressive miR-135a in breast cancer [ 39 ]. The activation of the ERK/ELK1/Snail signaling pathway underlies the promotive function of tumor-derived CXCL5 in colorectal cancer metastasis [ 40 ]. The literature mentioned above aids to supports the conclusion that hsa_circ_0000515 silencing could attenuate cervical cancer progression through miR-326-dependent ELK1 inhibition. Interestingly, ELK1 is an integration point associated with different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways [ 41 ]. This therefore gives rise to the highly possible involvement of potential MAPK signaling pathways in the hsa_circ_0000515/miR-326/ELK1 axis a question for the further researches.
