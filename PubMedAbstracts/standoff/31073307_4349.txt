 In many cases, microRNAs play essential roles in gene regulation [ 12 ]. miR-485-5p has been reported to suppress mitochondrial respiration, cell migration, and invasion in breast cancer cell lines [ 13 ]. In oral tongue squamous cells, miR-485-5p antagonizes PAK1 to reverse epithelial to mesenchymal transition and promote cisplatin-induced cell death [ 14 ]. miR-485-5p also could serve as a prognostic biomarker and associate with better survival in gastric cancer [ 15 â€“ 17 ]. Other microRNAs like miR-181c were reported to reduce the proliferation, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma cells through targeting Smad7 [ 18 ]. However, another report demonstrated that miR-181c functioned as an oncogene and promoted proliferation through inhibiting PTEN protein expression by targeting 3'-UTR of PTEN mRNA in inflammatory breast cancer SUM149 cells [ 19 ]. The mature form of miR-181c could also translocate into mitochondria and suppress the mitochondrial function through targeting of the mt-Cox1 gene [ 20 ]. Moreover, miR-181c was also reported to be involved in chemoresistance and antagonized long non-coding RNA GAS5 in pancreatic cancers [ 21 , 22 ]. It also contributed to the resistance of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer cells by targeting Wnt inhibition factor 1 [ 23 ]. Neither miR-485-5p nor miR-181c has been previously reported to target MCAK gene and reduce its expression level in cancers.
