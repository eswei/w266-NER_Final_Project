 The nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the most well-understood inflammasome and plays an important role in the process of inflammation. The NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3, the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and proinflammatory caspase-1. Upon activation of NLRP3 by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DPMPs), NLRP3 assembles and leads to the excretion of mature proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18 [ 9 ]. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the inflammatory process of atherosclerosis. The NLRP3 gene was identified as the genetic locus for three dominantly inherited periodic fevers: familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome [ 10 ], and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular syndrome/neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (CINCA/NOMID) [ 11 ]. These three diseases are collectively known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), suggesting that the disease-associated variants of NLRP3 probably encode a hyperactive version of NLRP3 which promotes excessive production of IL-1β [ 12 ]. NLRP3 gene mutations are also observed to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis [ 13 ], Crohn's disease [ 14 ], and abdominal aortic aneurysms [ 15 ]. One study from China suggested that genetic polymorphisms in NLRP3 may influence the risk of ischemic stroke in the Chinese population [ 16 ]. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited studies regarding the relationship between NLRP3 polymorphisms and susceptibility for LAA stroke and MES in the Chinese Han population. Therefore, we performed transcranial Doppler emboli detection and genotyped the NLRP3 gene polymorphisms to investigate whether NLRP3 gene polymorphisms are associated with LAA stroke and MES.
