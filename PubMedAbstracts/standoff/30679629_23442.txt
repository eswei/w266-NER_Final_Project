 In this study, c-myc was correlated with lymph node metastasis only in Uygur GC patients and not in Han GC patients. This may have been due to the different genetic backgrounds in different ethnic groups. The molecular mechanism of lymph node involvement and metastasis maybe different in these two ethnic groups. PVT1 was reported to regulate some molecules to promote involvement and migration. PVT1 can promote EMT and migration by down regulating p21 in pancreatic cancer cells ⁴⁴ . EMT in cancer cells leads to the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. In prostate cancer, PVT1 can act as a sponge for miRNA-186-5p and positively regulates Twist1 to promote EMT ⁴⁵ . PVT1 also decreases miR-195 expression by enhancing histone H3K27me3 and by direct sponging of miR-195 to modulate EMT in cervical cancer cells ⁴⁶ . In gastric cancer cells, whether PVT1 is related to these molecules and its functions are undefined. PVT1 also encodes a wide variety of non-coding RNAs, including a cluster of six annotated microRNAs: miR-1204, miR-1205, miR-1206, miR-1207-5p, miR-1207-3p, and miR-1208. miR-1204 targets VDR to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer ⁴⁷ . The molecular functions and effects of PVT1 in GC require further investigation. Further studies of these transcripts may provide novel insights into the functions of PVT1 in lymph node involvement.
