 The other interesting point in our patient was the presence of CKD (eGFR 43 ml/min per 1.73 m2, Grade 3b) with nephrotic range proteinuria. Renal biopsies of our patient showed FSGS as well as juxtaglomerular apparatus hyperplasia, interstitial fibrosis, as expected in BS and GS. Besides, dominant immunoglobulins (IgM +, IgA +/−) staining along with complements (C3 +/−) was demonstrated in the mesangium and capillary wall, which correlated with scattered electron dense mesangial deposits demonstrated by electron microscopy. These are several possible explanations for pathogenetic mechanisms of the changes BS patient kidneys. One possibility is that chronic stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which increased AngiotensinIIin response to chronic renal dysfunction due to salt-losing nephropathy [ 3 , 17 ]. Another point to consider is that prolonged hypokalemia can lead to hypertrophy and renal fibrosis through activation of transforming growth factor β [ 18 ]. Moreover, other studies suggested long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prematurity are increased risk factors for CKD [ 19 , 20 ]. After discharge, our patient was treated with orally administered potassium supplements, indomethacin and spironolactone. The patient’s creatinine clearance and proteinuria showed marked improvement with these treatments. The mechanism of CKD development is multifactorial, integrated control of serum electrolyte level, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (indomethacin) and aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone) application are key to reduce and delay patients with chronic renal failure in long-term follow-up. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the mutated proteins will contribute to targeted treatment in BS. Correcting deficiencies in mutated proteins and targeting treatment on mutant gene will shed new light on new therapy.
