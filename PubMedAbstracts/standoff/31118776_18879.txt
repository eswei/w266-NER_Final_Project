 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) is well known as a protective lipid for atherosclerosis, and can transport excess cholesterol from the periphery to the liver. Studies have demonstrated that it has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects, but that it also has a correlation with cancer incidence 21 – 24 such that that HDL increases cancer risk by 36% per 10 mg/L increase. There is also a positive correlation between HDL level and the prognosis of numerous cancers. 21 – 24 Moreover, HDL may directly or indirectly affect the incidence of colorectal tumors through several possible mechanisms. 25 – 29 HDL has been associated with increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), that reduce production of pro-inflammatory agents such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptors, thereby inhibiting cell growth and proliferation as well as promoting apoptosis. 25 – 27 In addition, HDL levels are closely related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 30 – 32 dry eye (DE), 33 , 34 and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 35 And some reports have suggested that high HDL levels are associated with an increased risk of AMD 30 – 32 whereas low HDL levels are relevant to DE and CVD. 33 – 35 In our study, the CRC patients with ocular metastases had increased serum levels of HDL, which is opposite to the correlation between HDL and the incidence of CRC, but in line with the changes in some ocular diseases.
