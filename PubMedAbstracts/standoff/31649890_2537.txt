 Semaphorins, multiple members of a family of signaling molecules, are known to be aberrantly expressed in cancers and have emerged as pivotal signals deregulated in tumorigenesis. Among the five classes of semaphorins expressed in vertebrates, class 3 semaphorins are present as secreted soluble molecules and that play an important role in numerous pathophysiological processes involved in malignant transformation ( 5 , 6 ). A previous study found SEMA3D to be an integration breakpoint of HPV in the human genome and that it may be a key factor in cervical cancer progression ( 7 ). Among other class 3 semaphorins, SEMA3C has been found to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis across multiple tumor types, including pancreatic ( 8 ), gastric ( 9 ), prostate ( 10 – 12 ), and breast cancer ( 13 – 15 ), as well as glioma ( 16 ). It is worth noting that full-length SEMA3C has also been reported as a tumor suppressor factor by suppressing tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis ( 17 ). In addition, it was found that SEMA3C could restrict the metastatic spread of neuroblastoma ( 18 ). Thus far, the role of SEMA3C in cervical cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the mRNA and protein expression levels of SEMA3C in cervical cancer tissues and investigate the impact of SEMA3C on cancer cell growth and signal pathway activation. In addition, we propose to analyze the relationship between SEMA3C expression and survival utilizing our cohort and a TCGA cohort.
