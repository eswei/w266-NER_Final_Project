 Evidence for altered KP metabolism in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD and ADHD, has been very limited to date. In this study, we found that the levels of KYN, AA, KYNA, and 3-HK and the KYN/TRP and KYNA/KYN ratios were significantly increased in the serum of adult Ptchd1 KO mice (Fig. 4A). The TPR breakdown index (KYN/TRP ratio) was significantly higher in Ptchd1 KO mice, and the findings are consistent with those in patients with ADHD and ASD. Moreover, significantly altered concentrations of KYN after ATX treatment correlated with behavioral improvements in Ptchd1 KO mice (Fig. 5A), suggesting that altered KP metabolites, particularly a high level of KYN, might be related to the pathological conditions of ADHD/ASD. Our findings also suggest that KP metabolism is activated in the periphery, and that activated KP metabolism increases the levels of KYN, which can cross the blood brain barrier and generate more neuroactive compounds affecting neuronal function or brain neurodevelopment. Imbalances in TRP metabolism ⁶⁶ and a lower serum levels of 3-HK ³⁰ have been observed in children with ADHD, and children with ADHD have higher levels of cytokines, including IL-6 and IFN-γ, which are known to activate KP and correlate with clinical parameters of attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity ³¹ . In addition, shorter pregnancy durations and lower birth weights are linked to symptom severities and increased 3-HK and IFN-γ levels in children with ADHD ³² . Moreover, ADHD children with or without comorbidities show significantly reduced AA and KYNA serum levels and increased TRP and KYN levels ⁶⁷ . In contrast, ADHD is associated with lower concentrations of TRP, KYNA, and 3-HAA in the serum in adults ⁶⁸ , and mean serum levels of TRP and KYNA and KYNA/KYN ratio are significantly lower in patients with ASD ⁶⁹ .
