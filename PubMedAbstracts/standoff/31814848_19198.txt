 The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that MIR100HG expression was increased in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, MIR100HG expression in advanced stage (III–IV) CRC tissues was significantly increased compared with low stage (I–II) CRC tissues, which was consistent with a previous study from The Cancer Genome Atlas data repository ( 24 ). Subsequently, the association between high MIR100HG expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with CRC was investigated. Previous studies on acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, early-stage cervical cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have reported that MIR100HG overexpression accelerates tumor malignancy and is associated with poor prognosis and survival ( 21 – 23 ). Similarly, the present study reported that MIR100HG overexpression was associated with poor prognosis and survival in patients with CRC. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that MIR100HG expression, AJCC stage, N classification, M classification and tumor differentiation were significantly associated with DFS and OS. Subsequently, in vitro cell function assays investigated the impact of MIR100HG on the migratory and invasive capacities of CRC cells. The results demonstrated that MIR100HG upregulation enhanced CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and liver metastasis in vivo. These findings suggested that MIR100HG may have crucial roles in CRC invasion and liver metastasis.
