 Some biomarkers have been confirmed in the development of osteoporosis. ALP [ 24 ], OSX [ 25 ], SOX9 [ 26 ], RUNX2 [ 27 , 28 ], and OCN [ 28 ] have been confirmed as having relationships to osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis often have lower ALP, OSX, SOX9, RUNX2, and OCN compared to healthy persons. In addition, RUNX2 is critical in regulating osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation [ 29 , 30 ]. Therefore, ALP, OSX, SOX9, RUNX2, and OCN could be considered as biomarkers of osteoporosis or osteoblastic differentiation. Previous investigations have proven that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of osteoporosis, which has also been considered a target in treating osteoporosis [ 31 – 34 ]. In our study, we found that sesamin might be an effective reagent in therapy for osteoporosis. In our cellular experiments, sesamin treatments improved ALP, OSX, SOX9, RUNX2, and OCN levels, and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway in BMSCs. Our animal experiments also provided evidence that sesamin treatments prevented the loss of OCN in the femur of rats with osteoporosis. Both these results not only align with previous research, but also indicate that sesamin has the ability to improve osteoblastic differentiation, and has therapeutic and preventive effects on osteoporosis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
