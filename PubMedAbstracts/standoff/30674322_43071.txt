 Among all pro-inflammatory cytokines i.e., TNF-α and IL-1β levels were increased in T2DM_CAD subjects as compared with control subjects. As per the previous literature, TNF-α induces insulin resistance by inhibiting IRS-1 phosphorylation and GLUT-4 expression, and elevated in patients with heart failure, and myocardial ischemia reperfusion [ 27 ]. Pu et al. reported the association of increased TNF-α levels with CAD among T2DM patients [ 28 ]. Increased TNF-α and IL-1β levels along with hyperglycemia helps to develop atherosclerosis [ 29 , 30 ]. Similarly, another pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 increased in both CAD and T2DM_CAD groups. However, the significant increase was observed in T2DM_CAD group as compared with T2DM. Increased IL-6 levels disturb the glucose metabolism and contribute to the development of insulin resistance. It is also reported earlier that IL-6 levels were positively correlated with CAD [ 31 ]. Present study showed that pro-inflammatory markers i.e., TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 together induce chronic inflammation condition to promote CAD in diabetes. Recently, CANTOS study reported that treatment with canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against IL-1beta in myocardial infraction patients showed dose-dependent decrease in IL-6 levels [ 6 ]. Serum markers like PDGF-BB, IP-10, resistin and PAI-1 levels were significantly increased in the CAD group, therefore representing specific markers for the CAD in the absence of diabetes. All these parameters help to develop atherosclerosis as reported earlier [ 32 – 37 ].
