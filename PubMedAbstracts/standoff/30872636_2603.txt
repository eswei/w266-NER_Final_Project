 CUL3 is involved in multiple intracellular pathways ⁷ including those activated by Wnt/β-catenin ⁸ , Hedgehog/Gli ⁹ , NF-kB ¹⁰ , Notch ¹¹ , Keap1/Nrf2 ¹² and cell cycle proteins ⁵ , ¹³ , all reported to be critical in kidney injury and fibrosis. In humans, Cul3 mutations are associated with renal cell carcinoma ¹⁴ and cause the disease Familial Hyperkalemic Hypertension (FHHt, also known pseudohypoaldosteronism II) ¹⁵ . We previously generated doxycycline-inducible renal epithelia-specific Cul3 knockout (KS-Cul3−/−) mice to investigate mechanisms underlying FHHt ⁶ . These mice display a complex phenotype, with increased activation of the thiazide-sensitive Na⁺-Cl− cotransporter (NCC), and polyuria due to a loss of aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Chronically, they displayed histological signs of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and increased expression of the CUL3 substrate cyclin E, but the originating tubule segment, the pathways dysregulated, and the time-course of the development of renal injury were not determined. Therefore, the aims of this study were to i) identify the site of acute tubule injury upon Cul3 deletion and to characterize the time-course of its transition into CKD, thus, establishing KS-Cul3−/− mice as a novel genetic CKD model; ii) test the hypothesis that dysregulation of the cell cycle and Keap1/Nrf2 pathway precedes tubule injury, and that the cyclin E inhibitor roscovitine ameliorates kidney injury; iii) test the hypothesis that CUL3 plays a broader role in kidney disease by examining CUL3 expression in mouse models of AKI and CKD, and in fibrotic human samples.
