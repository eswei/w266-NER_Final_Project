 In addition, several non-genetic diseases are associated with aortic damage, and the etiology can therefore be multifactorial (Hendel et al., 2015 ). Oxidative stress(OS), the degree of inflammation and edema may contribute to the progression of aortic tissue damage associated with endothelial dysfunction (Soto et al., 2016a ). In a preliminary study of our group, we evaluated the involvement of OS in different aortopathies in humans and correlated it with sub-endothelial basement membrane proteins and found the existence of dysfunction and progression of aortic damage (Soto et al., 2014 ). In another study, we showed that OS in MFS is associated with alterations in enzymes that employ glutathione, leading to increased chronic inflammation (Zúñiga-Muñoz et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, the vasomotor function in Marfan thoracic aorta is associated with an imbalance in the synthesis of thromboxane A₂ (TXA₂) and prostacyclin derived from the differential protein expression of cyclooxygenase (COXs) isoforms (Chung et al., 2007b ). Levels of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), TXA₂, and IL-6 were significant higher in aortic aneurysms and were associate with overexpression in the aneurysmal wall of the inflammatory cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (Cheuk and Cheng, 2007 ).
