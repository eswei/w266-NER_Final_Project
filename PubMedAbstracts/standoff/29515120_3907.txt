 Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, affect SuFu stability. Indeed, Shh signalling promotes ubiquitylation of SuFu leading to its proteasomal degradation ¹⁸ . This process is opposed by SuFu phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) that induce SuFu stabilisation ¹⁹ . By means of an enzymatic cascade involving an activating enzyme (E1), a conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ligase (E3) that determines substrate selectivity, ubiquitin is transferred to substrate proteins, generally inducing their degradation by the 26S proteasome ²⁰ , ²¹ . Ubiquitin-dependent events have emerged as crucial mechanisms by which stability, activity, or localisation of Gli proteins are controlled ³ , ²² , ²³ . Gli ubiquitylation is mediated by E3 ligases belonging to the RING-Cullin family, such as Cullin1-Slimb/βTrCP and Cullin3-HIB/Roadkill/SPOP ²⁴ – ²⁶ , and the HECT family, such as Itch ²⁷ , ²⁸ , as well as by PCAF (P300/CBP-associated factor), a histone acetyltransferase protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity ²⁹ , ³⁰ . Ubiquitylation promoted by these E3 ligases lead to either proteasome-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the Gli2 and Gli3 factors ²⁵ , ²⁶ or degradation of Gli1 ²⁴ , ²⁷ , ²⁸ . Although ubiquitylation is a relevant mechanism to control protein degradation ²¹ , it is also required for a variety of non-proteolytic functions.
