 Validation Phase This cohort included 200 patients with SAH, with a dominance of male patients (95%). In this cohort, plasma levels of PON1, APOB, APOA1, APOA2, and APOC3 were significantly lower, whereas APOC1 and APOE levels were significantly higher compared to AC (P < 0.05; Fig. 1C,D; Table 1).Total cholesterol, TGs, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol were also significantly higher in patients with SAH (P < 0.05; Table 1). IHC results were concordant with plasma results and showed significantly lower levels of PON1, LDLR, and ABCA1, whereas the levels of CD36, SRB1, and ABCG1 were increased in the liver of patients with SAH (P < 0.05; Fig. 1E). Together, these results suggest that low circulating levels of lipid transporter proteins are associated with severity of liver diseases. Further, low tissue expression of PON1, LDLR, and ABCA1 and a higher expression of the lipid‐uptake receptor (CD36, SRB1) could relate to the observed steatosis in alcoholics.
