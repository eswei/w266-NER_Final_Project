 FTO was originally reported as a demethylase for N3-methylthymidine in single-stranded DNA and for N3-methyluridine in single-stranded RNA in vitro. Depletion of FTO induces significant increase in total m6A levels of polyadenylated RNA. As FTO oxidizes m6A to A, it generates N6-hydroxymethyladenosine (hm6A) as an intermediate product, and N6-formyladenosine (f6A) as a further oxidized product. The potential function of these oxidized labile intermediates needs further exploration ( 17 ). Li et al. found that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of FTO can reduce the level of m⁶A methylation in the mRNA of ASB2 and RARA genes, which leads to the occurrence and development of AML, and it was found that high expression of FTO could inhibit the differentiation of AML cells into normal blood cells mediated by all-trans-retinoic acid ( 33 ). This makes the FTO demethylation gene an oncogene for AML. Zhou et al. found a significant increase in the expression of FTO in tumor tissues of patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), and found that these patients developed tolerance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This may be due to the fact that FTO reduces the m⁶A methylation level of certain genes, thereby activating the β-catenin pathway and affecting the expression of ERCC1 genes. In addition, it was also found that both FTO and β-catenin expression in CSCC patients showed a worse prognosis than patients who were elevated alone (P = 0.041). Thus, the expression of FTO and β-catenin has certain value in evaluating the clinical prognosis of CSCC ( 34 ).
