 MiR-181a-5p has been reported to play an important role in inflammation in macrophages and dendritic cells by targeting IL-β and c-Fos ²⁴ , ³⁹ . However, little is known about the functions of miR-181a-3p. Here, we provide evidence that both miR-181a-5p and miR-181a-3p are critical regulators of vascular inflammation. MiR-181a-5p and miR-181a-3p inhibit vascular inflammation through regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting TAB2 and NEMO, respectively, uncovering the common mechanism of the inhibitory effects of miR-181a-5p and miR-181a-3p on inflammation in response to different types of proinflammatory stimuli. NEMO is the essential regulatory/scaffold subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex for inflammation stimuli induced canonical NF-κB activation, leading to phosphorylation and degradation of IκBs and then nuclear translocation of p65 ⁴⁰ . It is reported that knockdown of NEMO by RNA interference in Jurkat or human primary T cells blocked inflammation signals such as TNF-α and LPS-induced NF-κB activation by adjusting IκBα degradation to happen later and last shorter ⁴¹ . As expect, miR-181a-3p decreased the expression of NEMO in HUVECs, leading to reducing ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin production by weakening of IκBα degradation and subsequent p65 nuclear translocation. TAB2 is an adapter protein that facilitates TNFα and IL-1β-mediated NF-κB activation ⁴² . Previous studys show that TAB2 and TAB3, two targets of miR-23b, are essential for autoimmune inflammation signaling mediated by TNF-α or IL-1β ⁴³ . Our present findings demonstrated that miR-181a-5p targeted TAB2 but not TAB3 and subsequently inhibited TNFα triggered NF-κB activation.
