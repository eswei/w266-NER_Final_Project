 Conclusion Our findings link Y-chromosomal genes known to be important and relevant for spermatogenesis in the curative hormonal treatment of cryptorchidism-induced infertility. Of note, our observation support data of global conservations of the epigenetic pattern associated with the sequences of the same origin (X-transposed, X-degenerate and ampliconic). This observations implicate Y-chromosomal genes, including USP9Y, UTY, TXLNGY, RBMY1B, RBMY1E, RBMY1J and TSPY4, some of which are known to be important for spermatogenesis, in the curative hormonal treatment of cryptorchidism-induced infertility.
