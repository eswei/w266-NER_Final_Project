 In clinics, the diagnosis of DOA needs to be differentiated from LHON, which is also a hereditary optic neuropathy. LHON is more common in young males and may have unilateral progression of vision loss. The fundus exam shows congested or hydropic optic disc borders and dilated peripheral capillaries in the early stage. Pale temporal optic disc and bilateral central or paracentral scotoma may be found in the later stage [ 31 ]. No gender difference was indicated in the family in this study (male-to-female ratio of 7 : 5), and the symptoms were observed in both eyes. The fundus exam of proband V-2 showed temporal pale optic disc without any congestion and no dilated peripheral capillaries. These clinical features support the initial diagnosis of DOA. Genetic tests can assist in differential diagnosis of DOA from LHON. LHON is a maternally inherited disease due to mitochondrial DNA mutation. The most common mutations are found in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit (ND) 4, ND1, and ND6 genes. Mutations in ND4 m.11778G>A, ND1 m.3460G>A, and ND6 m.14484T>C account for 50%–70%, 6%–25%, and 10%–15% of LHON patients, respectively [ 32 – 34 ]. In this study, we did not find any mtDNA mutations in LHON patients. In contrast, DOA is an autosomal inherited optic neuropathy, mainly caused by mutations of the OPA1 gene. To date, five genes (OPA1, OPA3 [ 35 ], AFG3L2 [ 36 ], DNM1L [ 37 ], and WFS1 [ 38 ]) have been identified as disease-causing genes for nonsyndromic DOA. In addition, six genetic loci have been reported to be responsible for DOA, including OPA2 (Xp11.4-p11.21), OPA4 (18q12.2-q12.3), OPA5 (22q12.1-q13.1), OPA6 (8q21-q22), OPA7 (11q14.1), and OPA8 (16q21-q22) [ 2 , 6 ]. Among them, OPA1 is the leading gene of DOA [ 39 ]. More than 280 OPA1 mutations have been reported to responsible for DOA (<url>; updated on December 30, 2018).
