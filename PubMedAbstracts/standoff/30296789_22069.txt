 Alprostadil is extensively used clinically for the treatment of multiple-system diseases [ 31 – 43 ]. However, the therapeutic effect of alprostadil in ARDS remains unclear. It was reported that Alprostadil exerts its effect through protecting the pulmonary vascular endothelial cells [ 8 – 10 ]. However, the OA-induced ARDS model features injury to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells [ 29 , 30 ]. Thus, in the present study, the OA-induced ARDS model was used to investigate the role of Alprostadil in ARDS. The lung W/D ratio, cytokine levels, and H&E and Masson trichrome staining of lung tissues were evaluated. The W/D ratio is considered as an indicator of lung edema [ 44 ], and OA has been reported to be able to augment edema formation and cytokine productions in the bronchoalveolar fluids of Swiss Webster mice [ 45 ]. TNF-α is known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and can stimulate the production of other cytokines [ 46 , 47 ]. Its production has been reported to be significantly increased in ALI/ARDS patients [ 48 , 49 ]. Masson trichrome staining was performed to observe the collagen formation in bronchial airways. Our results showed typical pathological changes in the lungs of OA-administrated rats, such as marked alveolar fluid, thickening of the alveolar wall and lungs, alveolar wall disruption and leukocyte infiltration, and collagen deposition in the lungs. The expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in the lung tissues were significantly increased, and the W/D ratio was increased in ARDS rats. The OA + Alprostadil group showed clearly reduced lung damage, the W/D ratio of rat lung tissues, and the production of TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as collagen formation, as compared with the OA model group. These data indicate the protective role of alprostadil in ARDS.
