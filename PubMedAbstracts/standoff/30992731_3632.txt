 Ring finger protein 213 (RNF213), especially the mutation of c.14576G>A, was proven to be strongly associated with MMD in Asian population, including Japanese, Korean, and Chinese [ 6 ]. Furthermore, Miyawaki et al. indicated ICASO without signs of MMD (non-MMD ICASO) was also related to the c.14576G>A variant in RNF213 [ 7 , 8 ]. Subsequently, Bang et al. not only repeatedly certified this view in Korean population [ 9 ] but also found that some RNF213 variant-related non-MMD ICASO could develop to MMD during follow-up [ 10 ]. This association of the c.14576G>A variant in RNF213 with non-MMD ICASO also has been proved in Chinese population by our previous study (unpublished data). Some researchers supposed that non-MMD with the c.14576G>A variant may be the MMD in an early stage so that we can differentiate early MMD from ICAD only by using genetic analysis [ 10 ]. However, Bang et al. recently discovered RNF213 is also a susceptibility gene for ICAD, which was confirmed by conventional angiography (absence of basal collaterals) and high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI, presence of plaque) in East Asians [ 11 ]. Therefore, only screening the RNF213 c.14576G>A variant could not accurately differentiate early MMD from atherosclerotic ICASO.
