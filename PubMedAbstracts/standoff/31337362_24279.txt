 Several of the co-expressed genes have been linked to various other cancers. Down-regulation of Fc fragment of IgG binding protein (FCGBP) has been associated with decreased overall survival in gallbladder adenocarcinoma [ 41 ] and with progression of prostate cancer in Transgenic adenocarcinoma Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) [ 42 ]. Upregulation of ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GALNAC1) has been associated with good prognosis in breast cancer [ 43 ]. Additionally, siRNA-mediated silencing of ST6GALNAC1 has been shown to lead to reduced growth, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro [ 44 ]. Estrogen-Induced Gene 121 Protein (KIAA1324), Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 261 (LINC00261), and Intelectin 1 (ITLN1) have been shown to function as tumor suppressors in gastric cancer, with decreased expression associated with poor prognosis [ 45 â€“ 47 ]. Low expression of Asparaginase-Like 1 Protein (ASRGL1) has been suggested as a marker for poor prognosis in endometrial carcinoma [ 48 ], whereas reduced levels of Solute carrier family 27 member 2 (SLC27A2) have been associated with poor survival in lung cancer [ 49 ]. SLIT and NTRK- like protein 6 (SLITRK6) is a known bladder tumor antigen, and is currently under investigation in clinical trials as a target for antibody-drug conjugate therapy [ 50 ]. HEPACAM family member 2 (HEPACAM2) is a paralog of Hepatocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (HEPACAM), which is known to act as a tumor suppressor by promoting differentiation [ 51 ]. HEPACAM2, however, is a relatively newly-identified molecule and is not well-studied.
