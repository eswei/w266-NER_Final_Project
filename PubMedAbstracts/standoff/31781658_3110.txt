 For cirrhotic patients, the increased expression of NOS and elevated NO concentration in peripheral blood are associated with a decrease in the inactivating effect of the liver on endotoxins and increased concentration of endotoxins in the blood circulation. However, the level of serum NO is estimated mainly by detecting its metabolites nitrate and nitrite, and the results can be inaccurate [ 5 , 6 ]. NO is formed in vivo from L-arginine and oxygen under the catalysis of NOS. In cirrhotic patients, the increased NO levels in pulmonary small airways and alveolar regions can lead to an increase in the eNO concentration [ 7 â€“ 9 ]. The increase in eNO is more common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, such as intrapulmonary vascular dilatation complicated with hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome and hepatopulmonary syndrome. The excessive elevation of eNO is predominantly associated with an increase in the release from pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and peripheral inflammatory cells [ 2 ]. The concentrations of eNO from different sites, such as central airway and alveoli, can be detected using different expiratory flows and operational formulas [ 8 , 10 , 11 ]. The eNO test is a noninvasive, simple, and economical method that reflects systemic inflammatory state and endothelial cell function, which may be closely related to the progression of cirrhosis [ 7 , 12 , 13 ]. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the relationship of the eNO level with the severity of liver cirrhosis and evaluate the predictive value of eNO as a noninvasive marker for HVPG in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension (CPH).
