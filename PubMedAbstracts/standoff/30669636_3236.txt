 Chronic skin inflammatory diseases are associated with a dysfunctional skin barrier that is characterized by elevated expression of various inflammatory stimuli, specifically pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 8 , 9 ]. In skin conditions like chronic inflammation, small signaling proteins, including chemokines, are secreted. The main function of these chemokines is to recruit leukocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils to inflammatory sites [ 10 , 11 ]. Specifically, in abnormal skin conditions like AD, chemokines have been reported to promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) proteins that cause itching [ 12 ]. Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) are a type of C-C chemokine that uses CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) as a receptor, and specifically binds to and induces chemotaxis in Th2 cells and is associated with Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as AD [ 13 ]. Another CC-chemokine, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), shares homology (37% amino acid identity) with CCL17, and both chemokines mediate a variety of biological activities through CCR4 [ 14 ]. Previous reports on the various pharmacological and medicinal functions of CCL17 and CCL22 in skin inflammation suggest that these chemokines can be used as biomarkers of chronic skin inflammation [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. Furthermore, CCL17 has been shown to be present at high levels in the blood of AD patients and highly expressed in skin lesions [ 15 ]. In addition, CCL22 expression was increased in the epidermis and serum of patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases [ 16 ]. These results indicate that CCL17 and CCL22 play crucial roles in the mobilization of Th2 cells and that increased expression of these chemokines further exacerbates chronic skin inflammation in diseases like AD [ 18 ].
