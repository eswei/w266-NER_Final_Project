 As a major class of small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs can mediate gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) or open reading frame (ORF) of genes. miRNAs are widely recognized to exert important effects on the malignant transformation of tumor cells, and the dysregulation of miRNAs is regarded as a hallmark of HNC [ 16 , 17 ]. As a crucial component of exosomes, miRNAs can be transported into recipient cells, thus influencing the crosstalk between tumor cells and non-tumor cells in the TME [ 18 – 21 ]. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs can be delivered from CAFs to tumor cells via exosomes; this process promotes tumor invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. It has been reported that miR-9, which is upregulated in breast cancer cells, could be secreted by fibroblasts via exosomes; this miR-9 secretion stimulates tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherin expression [ 13 ]. Another study indicated that CAF-derived exosomal miR-146a promoted the proliferation and gemcitabine resistance of tumor cells in pancreatic cancer [ 20 ]. Additionally, Chi et al. discovered that the exosomal transfer of stroma-derived miR-21 conferred paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells by targeting APAF1 [ 12 ]. The above data reveal that CAFs could functionally modulate the biological behaviors of tumor cells by delivering oncogenic miRNAs via exosomes. However, the loss of specific miRNAs in the exosomes of CAFs can also contribute to tumor progression. Zhang et al. found that the loss of exosomal miR-320a in CAFs contributed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and metastasis through the derepression of PBX3 [ 22 ]. Nevertheless, how the loss of specific exosomal miRNAs in CAFs affects the properties of HNC has not been well studied.
