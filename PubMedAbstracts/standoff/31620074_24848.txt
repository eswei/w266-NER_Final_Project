 In most of the previous studies, stress hyperglycemia was defined as absolute hyperglycemia without evidence of previously diagnosed diabetes or deterioration of pre-illness glycemic control with pre-existing diabetes ( 1 , 3 ). But this diagnostic criterion did not consider the background glucose level and could not differentiate the stress hyperglycemia from diabetes. On the contrary, glucose-to-HbA1c ratio, the indicator we used to measure stress hyperglycemia, reflects a quantitative measurement of the relative acute rapid increase of blood glucose level based on glucose level prior stroke. Recent studies demonstrated that relative hyperglycemia, defined as glucose-to-HbA1c ratio ( 6 ) or defined as admission glucose level divided by estimated average blood glucose level obtained by regression with HbA1c ( 2 ), might be a better predicter for outcomes of critical diseases than absolute hyperglycemia. Furthermore, unlike glucose-to-GA ratio, another relative measure of stress hyperglycemia, measures based on HbA1c could be commonly used and generalized in the clinical practice. Glucose-to-HbA1c ratio could be more stable than glucose-to-GA ratio since HbA1c reflects mean glycaemia over ~2–3 months while GA only represents mean glycaemia over ~2–4 weeks. On the other hand, measures of stress hyperglycemia based on HbA1c required a separate specimen of whole blood and may be affected by chronic kidney disease, anemia, or hemoglobinopathies ( 23 ). Nevertheless, HbA1c is a well-established biomarker and is commonly used in the clinical practice. Our study has suggested an easy-to-perform approach to detect and quantify stress hyperglycemia. This could be of importance to predict the outcome of non-diabetic patients with ischemic stroke at the acute phage.
