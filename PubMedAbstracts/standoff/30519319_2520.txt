 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential regulators of tumorigenesis and progression 5 . miRNAs directly bind to 3'-UTR of target mRNA via complementary pairing sequences 6 , which induces degradation of the target mRNA and/or leads to translational silence 6 . During the hepatocarcinogenesis, it has been demonstrated that miRNAs function as either tumor promoters or suppressors 7 - 9 . Recent years, abnormal expression of miRNA-376c is determined in several types of human cancer including ovarian cancer 10 , osteosarcoma 11 , head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 12 , colorectal cancer (CRC) 13 and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) 14 . Furthermore, deregulation of serum miR-376c is recognized as a novel prognostic as well as diagnostic marker in gliomas 15 , colon cancer 16 , breast cancers 17 - 19 and gastric cancer 20 , 21 . According to previous studies, miR-376c functions as either oncogenic or tumor suppressive miRNA , which depends on cancer types. For instance, miRNA-376c upregulation contributes to cell proliferation, survival and poorly response to chemotherapy, and inhibits apoptosis by repressing activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) in ovarian cancer 10 . In CRC, miR-376c-3p facilitates the growth of cancer cells by suppressing long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00152 13 . While, miR-376c overexpression restricts cell growth and migration in melanoma 22 . Restoration of miR-376c-3p expression suppresses migratory and invasive abilities of HNSCC cells by repressing runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) 12 . A recent study reports that miR-376c-3p is up-regulated in HBV-related HCC, suggesting an oncogenic role of miR-376c-3p in HCC 23 . Yet, the biological function of miR-376c-3p and its downstream target are still unclear in HCC progression.
