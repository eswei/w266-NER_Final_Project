 The current study investigated the numbers of circulating monocyte subpopulations and their potential association with disease severity in patients with early-stage IMN. In the study, the patients had higher CD14⁺CD163⁺ M2 monocyte counts than the HCs. Furthermore, the numbers of CD14⁺CD163⁺CD206⁺ M2 monocyte not only increased in the three subgroups of IMN but also shared the same changes in trend with disease progression. In other words, the CD206⁺ M2 cells were positively correlated with the degree of proteinuria. Similarly, a previous study has shown that CD206⁺ monocytes are associated with proteinuria in acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [ 18 ]. Therefore, our findings suggested that the increased CD14⁺CD163⁺CD206⁺ M2-like monocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of incipient IMN in adults and could serve as a sensitive indicator for evaluating IMN severity. The mechanism may be as follows: macrophage infiltration in tubulointerstitial lesion is a common case in the pathological process in incipient IMN. And the extent of proteinuria is a major determinant of tubulointerstitial damage. We hypothesized that such damage could trigger peripheral CD14⁺CD163⁺CD206⁺ M2-like monocytes, which may be stimulated by IL-4 and IL-13 from Th2-type immune responses in IMN [ 26 , 27 ], into renal tissues and contribute to tissue repair. Although having protective effect on renal injury, M2 monocytes can secrete fibronectin involved in renal fibrosis [ 13 ]. IMN can develop into chronic kidney disease characterized by progressive renal fibrosis. It is possible that increased CD14⁺CD163⁺CD206⁺ monocytes have profibrotic effect while they ameliorate proteinuria in IMN. However, the hypothesis should be investigated in detail in future studies.
