 Our in vitro kinase assays showed that mTORC3 has intrinsic rapamycin-resistant mTOR kinase activity. Yang and coworkers ( 6 ) reported that mTORC2 is sensitive to micromolar amounts of free rapamycin that binds to the Ser²⁰³⁵ rapamycin contact point in the FKBP-12–rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of mTOR, a condition we used for our inhibitor kinase assays (3 μM FKBP-12 + 10 μM rapamycin). This would explain the rapamycin-induced partial inhibition of the mTORC2 kinase activity in Fig. 3. Because this condition did not inhibit mTORC3 activity, we speculate that Ser²⁰³⁵ in mTORC3 is less accessible to rapamycin than it is in mTORC2, but further experimentation is needed to substantiate this possibility. Inhibition of in vitro mTORC3 kinase activity by the ATP-competitive inhibitors AZD-8055 and OSI-27 at mTOR kinase specific concentrations confirms that phosphorylation of the GST-p70S6Kᵀʰʳ³⁸⁹ fusion protein is the result of mTOR kinase activity and not of another kinase, given that the specificity of inhibition is 1000-fold [AZD-8055; ( 7 )] and 100-fold [OSI-27; ( 45 )] more potent for mTOR than for PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, or the PI3K-related protein kinase family members ataxia telangiectasia mutated and DNA-dependent protein kinase or 260 (AZD-8055) and 26 (OSI-027) other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases.
