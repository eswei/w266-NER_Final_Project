 Our present study revealed that a cutoff level of approximately 20 pg/mL of sNfL results in a rather high specificity (85%) in discriminating FTLD and PPD. Almost precisely similar cutoff concentration was suggested in a previous study comparing bvFTD patients and healthy controls [ 16 ]. Thus, these findings suggest that PPD may not affect the sNfL cutoff value compared to healthy controls and that the 20 pg/mL cutoff for sNfL may be used in clinical diagnostics between FTLD and non-neurodegenerative conditions (including PPD). The fact that a few patients in our PPD group showed slightly elevated concentrations (over 20 pg/mL) could indicate potential axonal damage in these patients, which might result from the underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other reason, such as minor head trauma. Interestingly, one previous study has shown slightly elevated CSF NfL levels in a subset of patients with bipolar disorder [ 17 ], but another study showed that CSF NfL levels in these patients were not associated with clinical outcomes or disease progression [ 18 ]. Although the relevance of sNfL in PPD requires further studies, it appears that the possible axonal injury for example in bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders is relatively minor and hence does not significantly affect the potential of using sNfL levels to differentiate between FTLD and PPD. Notably, the positive correlation between NfL levels and age has been observed in healthy controls as well as in patients with a neurodegenerative disease [ 19 â€“ 21 ], including our present study and, therefore, there may be a need for setting age-dependent cutoff values.
