 Based on our clinical and animal studies, it would appear that high phosphate intake increases the phosphate burden and the resulting phosphaturia produces secondary kidney damage by inducing tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis. Other studies have found that subjects with high serum phosphate had a higher risk for developing kidney disease ¹³ – ¹⁵ . In patients with more advanced renal disease, the progression of renal disease may be predetermined by other factors making it difficult to isolate phosphaturia as an independent factor predicting progression of renal disease. Moreover, in advanced CKD, the fractional excretion of phosphate is already very high limiting the capacity to further enhance phosphaturia. That is the reason hyperphosphatemia develops. At present, there are not studies in patients with CKD stages 2 to 3 in which the relationship between phosphaturia and progression of renal disease has been studied. In studies in patients with more advanced CKD from a variety of renal diseases and with different magnitudes of proteinuria, an effect of phosphaturia on renal disease progression has not been shown, but the limitation to further enhance phosphaturia may play a role ¹⁵ , ¹⁶ . Isakova T et al. found in patients with relatively preserved kidney function, GFR between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m², that high FGF23 was associated with significantly higher risk of end-stage renal disease. Unlike FGF23, neither PTH nor FePi were associated with mortality in fully adjusted models that excluded FGF23 ¹⁶ . As compared with our patients, patients from the Isakova’s study had more advanced stage of CKD with higher levels of FGF23 and more severe cardiovascular disease. At this stage of kidney failure other factors besides proteinuria and FePi may play a more relevant role in the renal disease progression.
