 Our study also implicated multiple functional variants in several novel genes as risk factors for AD. Mutations in ABCD4 cause an inborn error of vitamin B₁₂ metabolism. ⁵³ Vitamin B₁₂ deficiency is associated with cognitive impairment, and the level of circulating vitamin B₁₂ has been associated with AD risk. ⁵⁴ ABCD4 encodes an adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette transporter that is in the same family as well-established AD gene ABCA7. ³⁹ , ⁴⁰ The AD-associated CELSR1 <url> (P2983A) missense variant has also been associated with craniorachischisis, which is a severe neural tube defect, ⁵⁵ and other CELSR1 variants have been identified as ischemic stroke risk factors in Japanese individuals. ⁵⁶ The CELSR1-3 family of genes has multiple functions in the nervous system and distinct roles in brain development and maintenance. ⁵⁷ GTSE1 regulates G1/S cell cycle transition and microtubule stability and is involved in pivotal neurodegeneration pathways. ⁵⁸ It is not clear which of these CELSR1 and GTSE1 mutations may directly influence AD risk. LAMC3 encodes laminin subunit γ 3, and multiple experimental studies have linked laminins to AD. ⁵⁹ , ⁶⁰ LAMC3 has been significantly associated with age at onset of AD. ⁶¹
