 Indeed, abnormal lipid metabolism readily occurs in diabetes. In this study, the abnormal lipid metabolism was characterized by a significant increase in GDM with hyperlipidemia, such as LPCs, SM and Cer. Plasma levels of the LPC classes have been demonstrated to be correlated with plasma level of LDL ( Goncalves et al., 2012 ). Sphingomyelin (SM) was up-regulated in M cohort. Sphingolipid metabolism may be influenced by glucocorticoids, which can increase membrane sphingomyelin ( Cohen et al., 1986 ). Indeed, glucocorticoids levels are found to be increased in diabetes patients. These earlier data are in agreement with our observation of increased SM with the development of GDM. The role of ceramides in insulin resistance has been intensively investigated. It has been reported that exogenous ceramide administration induces apoptosis of the islet cells in the absence of fatty acids ( Shimabukuro et al., 1998 ). Ceramides play a vital role in TLR4-dependent insulin resistance in obesity ( Shi et al., 2006 ). Here, we found that the alterations of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were associated with serum levels of ceramides. It has been found that LPG was significantly increased in T2D patients ( Lu et al., 2016 ). Moreover, increase or decrease in production of PIPâ‚ƒ can result in obesity and diabetic phenotypes ( Manna and Jain, 2015 ). As expected, we found that the two lipid metabolites were significantly associated with Prevotella. Our data provide strong evidence that gut microbiome has a hand to play in the lipid metabolic mechanisms of GDM with hyperlipidemia. However, metagenomics could be done to identify the specific species. Our results indicate that plasma lipid classes might reflect some of abnormal changes during GDM development. Various biomarkers identified may worth further evaluation in prevention and treatment of GDM with hyperlipidemia.
