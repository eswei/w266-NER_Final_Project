 SLC3A2 forms a complex with LAT1 for amino acid transport activity ⁴ , ⁵ , ⁷ . We demonstrated that LAT1 expression level was gradually increased during HCV infection and SLC3A2/LAT1 complex level was also elevated in Jc1-infected cells. SLC3A2/LAT1 complex plays a critical role in the uptake of extracellular leucine, which subsequently leads to mTORC1 activation ²⁴ , ²⁶ . By siRNA-mediated silencing of SLC3A2/LAT1, we verified that SLC3A2/LAT1 complex was involved in L-leucine transport. Importantly, L-leucine transport level was significantly increased in Jc1-infected cells as compared with mock-infected cells. All these data indicate that the increase in amino acid transport in HCV-infected cells may be due to enhanced SLC3A2/LAT1 expression level. We then investigated the phosphorylation level of 4EBP1, a downstream target protein of mTORC1, in HCV infected cells. As expected, phospho-4EBP1 level was remarkably increased by HCV infection and HCV-induced phospho-4EBP1 level was pronouncedly decreased by BCH, indicating that SLC3A2/LAT1 complex was upregulated by HCV. Furthermore, cell proliferation was significantly decreased in both BCH-treated and SLC3A2/LAT1 knockdown cells, suggesting that HCV promoted cell proliferation by increasing leucine transport via mTORC1 signaling pathway for persistent infection.
