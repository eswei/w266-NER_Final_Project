 After analysis of microarray results, we identified differentially expressed lncRNA NAP1L6 in PCa. NAP1L6 contained 33.5 kb nucleotides and was located in Xq13.2. In 2014, Gazzellone et al reported that copy number variation of NAP1L6 might be related with autism spectrum disorder in Han Chinese individuals. 23 However, it has not been reported in any of the tumor-related studies till now. In our study, NAP1L6 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells by regulating the expression of INHBA. Recently, regulative function of INHBA in cancer had attracted researchersâ€™ attention. Si et al indicated that high expression of INHBA was an adverse prognostic factor for de novo acute myeloid leukemia. 24 In terms of solid tumors, INHBA expression levels were found to be significantly higher in cancer tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa in patients with stage II/III gastric cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1. Moreover, results of clinicopathological data analysis demonstrated that high INHBA expression was associated with significantly poorer 5-year survival. 25 In PCa, INHBA was found to be over-expressed in high-grade disease. 26 Furthermore, Tandefelt et al reported that INHBA participated in PCa progression in in vitro biologic assays. 27 However, the specific mechanism of regulation remains to be explored.
