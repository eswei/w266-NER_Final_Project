 Previous studies have shown that miR-544 targets different genes in various cancer types. In osteosarcoma, miR-544 promotes cell proliferation by negatively regulating axin-2 ( 8 ). In hepatocellular carcinoma, it enhances immune escape through downregulation of natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1/NKp46 by targeting runt-related transcription factor 3 ( 9 ). miR-544 also promotes the cell proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer by directly targeting forkhead box O1 ( 10 ). In glioblastoma, miR-544 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration and increases cell apoptosis by targeting Parkinsonism associated deglycase ( 13 ). Previous data have reported that E2F5 is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, ESCC, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma; it was also associated with cancer progression and prognosis ( 17 â€“ 21 ). Certain miRNAs, such as miR-34a and miR-1179, could regulate the function of E2F5 ( 22 , 23 ). However, the mechanism of E2F5 in ESCC, as well as the correlation of miRNAs and E2F5 in ESCC, was not completely demonstrated. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that miR-544 could negatively regulate E2F5 in ESCC by using a luciferase assay, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR. E2F5 overexpression could rescue the inhibitory effect of miR-544 mimics in ESCC cells. These data demonstrate that E2F5 is a functional target gene of miR-544. Moreover, the expression levels of miR-544 and E2F5 were negatively correlated in ESCC tissues. The function of E2F5 in drug resistance is beyond the scope of the present study; however, it will be the focus of future studies.
