 Many works have been done to unveil a group of cytokines known as type I interferon-regulated chemokines that plays a significant role in the development of IIM. With regard to cytokines, it has been demonstrated that CXCL9 and IP-10 are associated with anti-JO-1 antibody-associated ILD [ 26 ]. Bilgic H and Gono T individually reported that the serum levels of IL-6 were significantly correlated with dermatomyositis disease activity [ 27 , 28 ]. Consistent with previous studies, our data also demonstrated that the levels of IP-10, IL-6, MCP-1, and VEGF were significantly elevated in our patients with anti-EJ and were gradually decreased during disease remission of two patients. It is notable that the serum levels of IL-8 were obviously decreased in four patients positive with anti-EJ in the present study, but to a lesser extent. Gono T showed that IL-8 levels were significantly higher in the ILD subset of myositis especially in anti-MDA5-ILD, indicating that serum IL-8 is a useful predictor for fatal outcome due to ILD [ 28 ]. In the study of Bilgic H, the serum levels of IL-8 were also significantly lower in adult DM and juvenile DM than those in health controls [ 27 ]. The controversial data about serum IL-8 level of myositis patients may attribute to small number of patients, determination of myositis specific antibodies, and serum sampling time and so on.
