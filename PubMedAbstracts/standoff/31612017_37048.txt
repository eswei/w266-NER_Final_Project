 The formation of various types of tumor in humans is modulated by NOTCH signaling pathway, which has been reported to serve a crucial role in the development and formation of normal choroid plexus ( 54 ). Insertion of G and A in PARP1 gene (c.1056_1057insG and c.1056_1057insA) causes a frameshift in the reading frame and a termination at 35th coding position from this insertion. In addition, insertion of G (c.21904_21905insG) in PARP1 causes a frameshift in the reading frame and a termination codon at 3rd coding position from insertion ( 55 ). PARP enzymes are involved in DNA damage repair ( 56 ). Mutations in SYNE1 (ARCA1) gene are known to cause autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type-1 ( 57 ), and patients with CPP are known to have symptoms of ataxia ( 5 ). Previous studies reported that SYNE1 and STK36 mutations are present in GBM cases ( 58 ). In addition, deletion variant in NOTCH1 [c.4732_4734delGTG p. (Val1578delVal)], which causes a frameshift in reading frame, was also observed in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, but this variant has not previously reported in GBM ( 59 ). Mutations in NOTCH1 are associated with altered drug sensitivity, such as to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( 60 ). Frameshift-deletion in exon 26 of NOTCH1 has been reported in hematopoietic and lymphoid skin, salivary gland and thymus ( 61 ). KDM5C, also known as ‘Jumonji. AT-rich interactive domain 1c’ JARID1C, codes for a histone demethylase, and mutations in this gene are associated with mental retardation and microcephaly ( 62 ). This suggests that alteration in chromatin remodeling might serves a role in CPP. It is therefore crucial to further investigate choroid plexus tumor to better understand the role of chromatin remodeling, since this type of tumor exhibits mutations in enzymes responsible for chromatin remodeling, including PARP, SMARCA4 and ATM. A mutation in GATA2 gene [c.967C>T p. (His323Tyr)] has been previously identified in large intestine with a FATHMM prediction score of 1.00 ( 25 ). To the best of our knowledge, the missense mutation detected in the GATA2 gene in the present study has not yet been reported in GBM tumors. GATA2 is a hematopoietic factor that has been implicated in hematopoietic malignancies, and this transcription factor has been implicated in prostate tumorigenesis ( 63 , 64 ).
