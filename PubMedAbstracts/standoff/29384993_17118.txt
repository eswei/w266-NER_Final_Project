 Balasubramaniyan et al. 17 reported that brain ADMA levels were significantly higher in adult rats 4 weeks after BDL and their ADMA levels were reduced after treatment with ornithine phenylacetate. Similarly, Bajaj et al. 18 reported that patients with liver cirrhosis showed cognition dysfunction and higher serum ADMA levels. We have previously shown that rats with BDL for 2 weeks had increased plasma ADMA levels as well as cognitive deficits 19 . Here, we replicate our previous findings, showing increased ADMA levels in the prefrontal cortex in rats 4 weeks after BDL 5 . The prefrontal cortex plays a role in memory, attentiveness, and perceptual awareness. The dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus have distinct neuroanatomical profiles, whereas the dorsal hippocampus is primarily involved in cognition 20 . Spatial memory needs a wider network of inter-connected brain regions including the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Rats with lesions of the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus show spatial deficits 21 . In our previous study, the entire hippocampus did not show a significant difference in ADMA levels between controls and 4-week BDL rats 5 . Here, we found increased ADMA concentration in the dorsal hippocampus in 4-week BDL rats, that is, the BDL group, and melatonin infusion therapy prevented the increase in ADMA. In addition, IHC staining showed a protective effect of melatonin against increased hippocampal ADMA expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the protective effect of melatonin against increases of ADMA levels in the dorsal hippocampus in a brain disorder.
