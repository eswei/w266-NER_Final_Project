 miRNAs are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and thus serve an essential role in numerous biological processes, including cancer cell proliferation ( 28 , 29 ). miR-371a-3p has been associated with tumor cell proliferation ( 30 ). Although previous studies have indicated that serum miR-371a-3p may be a novel biomarker for tumor cells ( 31 , 32 ), the association between miR-371a-3p and CRT sensitivity in LARC remains unknown. In the present study, the miRNA-target gene interaction analysis revealed that miR-371a-3p was downregulated. This result may indicate that miR-371a-3p is a potential factor for predicting CRT sensitivity in LARC. However, investigation of the mechanism of the effect of miR-371a-3p on CRT sensitivity is lacking. Notably, pathway analysis in the current study showed that thiamine metabolism was the pathway with the highest enrichment by miR-371a-3p. The role of thiamine in cancer is controversial according to previous studies. In one study, thiamine intake was inversely correlated with colon cancer risk ( 33 ). However, another study indicated that increased thiamine levels were beneficial for tumor cell survival, proliferation and chemotherapy resistance ( 34 ). Therefore, downregulated miR-371a-3p may affect CRT sensitivity in patients with LARC via the thiamine metabolism pathway.
