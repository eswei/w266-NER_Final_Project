 Moreover, in vivo, we found that SAF treatment markedly reduced tumor growth in an HCC xenograft mouse model. Here, we demonstrated that SAF affected the biomarkers of HCC tumors. The ADC value, derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is a sensitive biomarker for predicting early treatment responses in various malignant tumors that was used to assess tumor cellularity, tumor necrosis, cell density and apoptosis [ 21 , 46 ]. Previous studies reported that ADC values were increased after cisplatin treatment in an ovarian cancer model [ 47 ], after sorafenib treatment in breast cancer xenografts [ 48 ], and after irinotecan treatment in colon carcinoma xenografts [ 49 ]. Hence, we used DW-MRI to monitor the ADC values in HCC xenografts in response to SAF therapy. Interestingly, our findings are consistent with previous studies. The ADC values were increased after SAF treatment in tumors. The increase in ADC values was attributed to tumor cell death and apoptosis. These results were supported by the H–E and western blotting assays. Increased tumor necrosis and less compact cell spaces were observed in SAF-treated tumors with H–E staining, and higher levels of the proapoptotic proteins cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-7 were detected in SAF-treated tumors by western blotting. Therefore, our findings further suggest that SAF plays a vital role in the antitumor effect of HCC.
