 The roles of miR-107 are different for different cancers. For example miR-107 is a suppressor of breast cancer 44 , 45 , renal cancer 46 and glioma 47 ; in contrast, this miRNA can promote human gastric cancer 48 , 49 and hepatocellular carcinoma 50 . In 2014, Wang et al. found that the TT genotype of rs2296616 was a risk factor for gastric cancer 51 . In addition, they also found that the TT genotype was associated with higher miR-107 expression than the CC genotype 51 . MiR-125a is a suppressor of colon cancer 52 , prostate cancer 53 , ovarian cancer 54 , breast cancer 55 and prostate cancer 56 . In cervical cancer, miR-125a suppresses tumour growth, invasion and metastasis by targeting STAT3. In 2016, Xu et al. 57 reported that the AA genotype of rs8111742 in miR-125a increased the risk for gastric cancer associated with H. pylori, and this same effect was found by Wu et al. 58 in the H. pylori-positive group. SNP rs999885, located at the promoter region of the miR-106b-25 cluster, has been reported to be associated with the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma 59 . It was reported that rs1143770 in the let7-a-2 gene is associated with non-small-cell lung cancer 60 but not gastric cancer 61 . In the current study, we did not find that rs2296616, rs8111742, rs999885 and rs1143770 were associated with cervical cancer. The reasons for these differences between the other studies and the current study could be the various roles of the same miRNAs in different human cancers, and this possibility is supported by the tissue-specific expression of miRNAs 62 . Thus, it is necessary to investigate the function of the SNPs in miRNA genes in specific tissues.
