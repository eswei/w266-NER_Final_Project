 In vivo we observed a significant difference in size between erlotinib- and vehicle-treated PC9ᵍCᵀᴿ xenografted tumors, a difference not present in PC9ᵍFᴳFᴿ¹ tumors. Gene expression analysis revealed a persistent FGFR1 gene up-regulation in PC9ᵍFᴳFᴿ¹ at the end of the in vivo experiment in both vehicle- and erlotinib-treated mice. Analyses of human/mouse RNA-ratios in the tumors revealed decreased contribution from human cancer cells in erlotinib-treated PC9ᵍCᵀᴿ xenografts compared to vehicle treated, supporting a pronounced erlotinib-induced PC9ᵍCᵀᴿ cell death. In addition, the increased mouse cell contribution may have led to an overestimated tumor size in erlotinib-treated PC9ᵍCᵀᴿ xenografts during the experiment. We measured the FGF2 levels in the tumor tissue and observed FGF2 levels in the order of 20–80 pg/μg protein for all tumor samples. The FGF2 levels correlated with tumor size in PC9ᵍFᴳFᴿ¹ xenografts, but not in PC9ᵍCᵀᴿ xenografts suggesting a role for the FGF2-FGFR1 pathway in tumor growth. For PC9ᵍCᵀᴿ tumors FGF2 levels in the erlotinib treated tumor group was higher than expected. This could be a consequence of a higher degree of mouse cell infiltration. We also observed presence of significantly lower FGF2 levels in erlotinib-treated PC9ᵍFᴳFᴿ¹ xenografts compared to vehicle-treated PC9ᵍFᴳFᴿ¹ xenografts. This difference in FGF2-levels could indicate a greater turnover of FGF2 in the tumors caused by FGF2-internalization upon receptor-binding or may partly be due to a tendency towards larger sizes of vehicle tumors (Figure 5D) [30] .
