 Introduction von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with a predisposition to highly vascularized tumors development. The most common VHL manifestations are hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and pheochromocytomas ¹ . It is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene VHL ¹ – ³ . VHL protein is the substrate recognition component of the E3 ligase complex, composed of Cullin-2, Rbx1, Elongin B, Elongin C, and pVHL, that participates in the oxygen-sensing system that drives Hypoxia inducible factors alpha (HIF) degradation ⁴ . When VHL gene is mutated and its function is modified or lost, HIF-1/2-α subunits are stabilized and HIF target genes become activated ⁵ , ⁶ . HIF activity is linked to tumor angiogenesis, invasion, cancer metabolic reprogramming, and metastasis ⁵ , ⁷ . Although HIF-1α and HIF-2α have been associated with poor prognosis in many human cancers ⁵ , in some tumors only one HIF-α subunit is correlated with prognosis. Moreover, in some tumor models the expression of HIF-1-α or 2-α subunits can lead to a divergent outcome ⁸ , probably caused by differential recruitment of coactivators or corepressors to HIF-targeted gene promoters and activation of non-overlapping transcriptional programs ⁴ , ⁵ , ⁸ . In RCCs, which are the leading cause of mortality among VHL patients ⁶ , cumulative evidence support the role of HIF-2 as the driving force for tumor progression ⁹ . In this regard, there is increasing number of therapies for RCCs that suppress angiogenesis through targeting HIF-VEGF signaling ⁹ , ¹⁰ . Nonetheless, the resistance to this therapy remains a major issue ⁹ and opens the question on the existence of other factors participating in this process ¹¹ .
