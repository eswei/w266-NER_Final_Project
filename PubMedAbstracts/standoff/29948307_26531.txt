 In a subgroup of patients whose follow-up data were available, we attempted to investigate the association of uEGF/Cr with progression of Alport syndrome. Due to small sample size and relatively short follow-up time, we defined “progression” as CKD stage advanced. This definition has been applied in multiple studies by independent groups and was considered acceptable [ 27 – 30 ]. We observed that uEGF/Cr levels at baseline in “progressors” were already significantly lower than those in “non-progressors.” Next, uEGF/Cr’s prognostic value was reflected by its significant correlation with eGFR slope (Fig. 5a). The progressors were clustered together by their low uEGF/Cr and steeper eGFR slope (Fig. 5a). While it is not surprising that steeper eGFR slope highly associated with progression to higher CKD stage, it is encouraging to observe that uEGF/Cr shows a high correlation with eGFR slope and progression. This result confirmed our previous finding in general adult CKD [ 13 ]. The association of uEGF/Cr with progression is likely due to the regenerative function of EGF [ 16 ]. Lower uEGF/Cr is not only an indication of current reduced kidney tubular mass thereby a good biomarker for cross-sectional kidney function, it also represents impaired regenerative function of the tubular cells, which is directly associated with progression. Finally, uEGF/Cr exhibited superior AUC compared to eGFR and proteinuria. Adding uEGF/Cr to the base model including eGFR and proteinuria resulted in a significant improvement of AUC. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, uEGF/Cr was reported to have additive prognostic value for CKD progression in patients with Alport syndrome.
