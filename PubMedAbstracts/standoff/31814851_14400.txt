 Accumulating evidence shows that HJURP may be an oncogene that has a crucial role in PCa ( 10 – 12 ). To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to report the role of HJURP expression in PCa. The findings demonstrated that HJURP was upregulated in PCa tissues compared with benign prostate tissues, which was in accordance with the Taylor dataset. Upregulation of HJURP has also been identified in other types of cancer, including brain, breast, ovarian and lung cancer, suggesting that HJURP may be involved in tumor progression ( 10 – 13 ). According to the analysis of the Taylor dataset in the present study, upregulation of HJURP was associated with aggressive tumor progression in patients with PCa. In addition, Kaplan-Meier results indicated that high HJURP mRNA expression was associated with shorter BCR-free survival time, and hence, HJURP expression may be useful to determine BCR-free survival in patients with PCa. It has been previously reported that upregulation of HJURP mRNA is associated with the progesterone and estrogen negative status, which has relatively poor prognosis and aggressive behavior in breast cancer ( 11 ). Similar results have also been identified in lung cancer and glioma reports ( 12 , 13 ).
