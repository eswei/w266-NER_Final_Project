 SZ163 and SZ168, two mAbs against human PDPN previously produced in our laboratory, showed high reactivity with PDPN-expressing cell lines CHO/hPDPN, U87, and NCI-H226. In the present study, we found that SZ163 and SZ168 specifically recognize endogenous hPDPN in cancer cell lines C8161 and CNE-2 by flow cytometry and western blot. Furthermore, comparison of the reactivity between SZ168 and 18H5 against hPDPN showed that SZ168 may be more sensitive and useful than 18H5 in flow cytometry. Moreover, SZ168 significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by C8161, CNE-2, NCI-H226, or CHO/hPDPN in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SZ163 IgG did not. Furthermore, SZ168 suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in CHO/hPDPN and C8161cells in vivo. Both tumor weight and the number of lung micro-metastasis foci were significantly lower in the mice treated with SZ168 than in those treated with control mouse IgG group. It is reported that NZ-1 and MS-1 inhibit PDPN-CLEC-2 interaction in vitro, but whether these antibodies suppress human cancer growth and/or metastasis remains unknown [ 23 , 34 ]. We found that SZ168 not only suppresses PDPN-induced platelet aggregation in vitro but also inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in both mouse (CHO/hPDPN) and human (C8161) cancer cells. The experimental results confirmed that the PDGF and TGFβ-1 secreted by platelets can significantly promote the metastasis of tumor cells. Moreover, the migration-promoting effects of PDGF and TGF-β were partially inhibited by the mAb SZ-168. Furthermore, SZ168 may also be useful for diagnostics in immuno-histochemical analysis due to its high sensitivity, similar to another anti-PDPN antibody, D2–40, which has been used as a marker for the diagnosis of many different human tumors by immunohistochemical analysis [ 5 , 35 ].
