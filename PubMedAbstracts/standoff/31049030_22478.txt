 In the present study, we have ascertained novel molecular mechanisms miR-591 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer. We found that miR-519 expression was low in breast cancer tissues and cells. Lower miR-591 expression notably related to lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. Bone metastasis is frequent in breast cancer patients, in the study, the clinical analysis results showed no association between miR-519 expression and bone metastasis. We speculated the cases number may be inadequate and needed to extend the cases in the further. Moreover, the cell lines use in the study is not association with osteotropism, we did evaluate the expression of miR-591 is lower in several breast cancer cell lines. In vitro, cell proliferation and invasion were inhibited by transfection of miR-591 mimic in breast cancer. In vivo, our results also indicated that upregulation of miR-591 suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vivo. Moreover, we identified that TCF4 was a target of miR-591 in breast cancer. TCF4 play crucial functional role in breast cancer. The TCF4/Î²-catenin pathway and chromatin structure cooperate to regulate d-glucuronyl C5-epimerase expression in breast cancer [ 14 ]. MicroRNA-100 suppresses the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by targeting FZD-8 and inhibiting T-cell factor-4 (TCF-4) expression [ 15 ]. By upregulating the TCF4 expression, we demonstrated that TCF4 mediated the inhibiting effects of miR-591 expression on cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells.
