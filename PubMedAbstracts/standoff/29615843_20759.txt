 Ho et al claimed that ZWINT was upregulated during bladder cancer pathogenesis in the FGFR3-non-mutated tumor pathway. 11 Incidence of thanatophoric dysplasia mutations in FGFR3 gene was significantly higher in low-grade or superficial tumors than high-grade or muscle-invasive tumors. 25 In this study, we found by GEO31210 analysis that the expression level of gene ZWINT was higher in the EGFR-non-mutated group than in the EGFR-mutated group. Lung ADC with EGFR-activating mutations responded well to gefitinib. 26 For the EGFR-non-mutated lung cancer patients, high expression of ZWINT may be a potential therapeutic target. Endo et al found that the growth rate of breast cancer MCF7 cells was significantly increased by stable expression of ZWINT. 7 Moreover, aromatase inhibitor treatment of breast cancer is associated with changes in the expression of ZWINT. 8 The study demonstrated that the expression of ZWINT was increased in castration-resistant prostate containing AR gene amplification with high AR expression, 9 and COX-2 inhibitors arrested prostate cancer cell cycle progression by down-regulation of kinetochore/centromere ZWINT proteins. 10
