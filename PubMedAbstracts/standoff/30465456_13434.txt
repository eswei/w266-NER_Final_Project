 Vitamin D is a key element in calcium metabolism, and previous studies have shown that reduced serum levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D are associated with musculoskeletal disorders, such as chronic low back-leg pain and fibromyalgia, however, data regarding vitamin D status and TMDs are limited. ¹⁴ , ¹⁵ In an experimental model, Shen et al. ¹⁶ reported that vitamin D deficiency was correlated with an erosive temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis through induction of DNA damage and production of inflammatory cytokines. Decreased vitamin D levels have also been associated with radiographic changes in the temporomandibular joint. ¹⁷ However, the relationships between TMDs and vitamin D status, parathyroid hormone levels and calcium metabolism have not yet been evaluated in detail. In the present study, patients with TMDs were revealed to have significantly higher parathyroid hormone levels compared with control patients, while serum levels of vitamin D were low in both groups, and phosphorus and calcium were within normal ranges. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding serum calcitonin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. The similar vitamin D deficiency rates in both groups may be related to the lack of a significant difference between the groups regarding calcium, magnesium and phosphorus levels.
