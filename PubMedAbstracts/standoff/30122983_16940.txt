 This study also revealed that the lung metastasis of endometrial cancer is related to miR-1247, which may be related to the lung affinity of miR-1247. Studies have shown that silencing of miR-1247 by DNA methylation can promote the invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer, and STMN1 was found to be a direct target gene of miR-1247, whereas upregulation of miR-1247 can inhibit the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer. 18 Furthermore, miR-1247-3P is known to be activated by fibroblasts leading to lung metastasis of hepatoma cells. 19 These findings suggest that miR-1247 may have lung affinity, and the elevated miR-1247 levels in pathological specimens may increase the detection rate of lung metastases. We have found that miR-1247 may be related to target genes such as NRP2, KLH17, SEMA6D, MYCBP2, MPP3, CARD14, TMEM184B, NHLH1, PFKFB3, MRPS23, SFRP5, and ALDH1A3. Target gene prediction can provide directions for further research on their roles and respective mechanisms of action in cancer.
