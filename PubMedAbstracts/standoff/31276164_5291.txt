 Another factor implicated in the mechanism of arrested follicle growth in PCOS is AMH, a key member of the TGF-Î² superfamily of growth factors important for normal follicle development. Furthermore, researchers recently reported that treatment of pregnant mice with AMH results in a PCOS-like phenotype in the offspring, via a mechanism that implies a neuroendocrine action of AMH ( 16 ). Most of circulating AMH is produced by GCs of large preantral and small antral follicles ( 17 , 18 ). AMH inhibits FSH-induced estradiol production by GCs in vitro ( 19 ) and, because AMH production is higher in women with PCOS ( 20 , 21 ), the higher ovarian levels of AMH are thought to impair antral follicle function and contribute to follicle arrest ( 22 ). It has been concluded, on the basis of correlating serum AMH with antral follicle count on ultrasonography, that the production of AMH per follicle is increased in PCOS ( 23 , 24 ). This view is supported by a study showing that concentrations of AMH (as measured by ELISA) were much higher in conditioned media of cultured GCs from women with PCOS compared with follicles from controls, although concentrations of AMH follicular fluid between polycystic and normal ovaries were not measured ( 25 ). Although AMH gene expression has been measured in luteinized GCs from gonadotropin-stimulated cycles (and reported to be higher than normal in women with PCOS) ( 26 ) it has not, to our knowledge, been measured in GCs from individual, matched, unstimulated follicles in women with and without PCO.
