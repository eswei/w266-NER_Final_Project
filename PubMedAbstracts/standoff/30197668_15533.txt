 miRNAs can stably exist in body fluids including serum, plasma, saliva, urine and tears ( 22 , 23 ). Furthermore, miRNAs can be easily detected in small amounts in samples and are resistant against degradation ( 24 ). These characteristics of miRNAs render them attractive as potential biomarkers ( 8 , 25 ). In the present study, we detected the level of miR-26a-5p in BC patients and our data showed that plasma miR-26a-5p was significantly increased in BC patients. Furthermore, miR-26a-5p expression was also elevated in the BC tissues compared with adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. Further analysis showed positive correlation between miR-26a-5p and clinical outcome. Compared with BC patients at Ta-T1 stage, the level of miR-26a-5p was significantly enhanced in BC patients â‰¥T2. Furthermore, BC patients at G3 stage demonstrated much higher plasma miR-26a-5p level than those at G1/2 stage. These data showed that miR-26a-5p positively correlated with therapy and outcome. ROC analysis indicated miR-26a-5p could differentiate BC patients from healthy controls. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that plasma miR-26a-5p negatively correlated with survival of BC patients. These data indicated that plasma miR-26a-5p may be useful for the early detection of cancer and individualized therapies.
