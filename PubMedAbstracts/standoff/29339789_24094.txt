 To further investigate the miR-155 role in exosome chemoresistance transmission, we overexpressed miR-155 in breast cancer cells which led to high miR-155 exosome level. When we cultivated these exosomes with breast cancer cells, there was also a miR-155 enrichment in recipient cells, indicating miR-155 transfer through exosomes. It has been shown that, C/EBP-β (a mediator of TGF-β) and FOXO3a are miR-155-validated targets ³⁹ , ⁴⁰ . Moreover, TGF-β is a cytokine that plays central role in EMT, is also regulated by miR-155 ⁴¹ . Indeed, the overexpression of miR-155 led to the downregulation of its target genes, in both miR-155 mimic and miR-155 mimic´ exosome co-cultured cells, confirming this regulatory effect. Despite some evidence showing that miR-155 can promotes EMT and CSC phenotypes ⁴² , ⁴³ , how miR-155 regulates EMT remains unclear. In the current work, we show that breast cancer cells overexpressing miR-155 acquired EMT properties, promoted higher migration rate, and were able to form more mammospheres, which suggest that miR-155 may regulate certain genes related to breast CSCs that are resistant to therapy. Interestingly, this landscape was also observed when the exosomes expressing high miR-155 level were endocytosed into the breast cancer cells, indicating the functional role of miR-155 exosome delivery. Mikamori et al. ⁴⁴ have reported in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model, that miR-155 induces exosome secretion that causes gemcitabine resistance. In accordance to this study, our data shows that the cells that received exosomes from overexpressing miR-155 cells were significantly more resistant to DOX and PTX than cells that received exosomes from control cells, which suggests that miR-155 effectively elicits PTX resistance in breast cells via exosome uptake.
