 Here we showed that ACS patients had higher MPV compared to non-ACS patients, suggesting that MPV be utilized as an independent biomarker for ACS diagnosis (Table 2). The AUC of the MPV in ACS diagnosis was 0.736, and the optimal cut-off was set as 10.55 fL with the 54.2% of sensitivity, the 83.3% of specificity, the 3.345 of LR⁺, and the 0.546 of LR—. When MPV was combined to initial TnI for ACS diagnosis, the ACU was increased to 0.822 in 83.1% of sensitivity, 75.7% of specificity, 3.414 of LR⁺, and 0.224 of LR— (Table 3). In standard diagnosis of TnI, TnI should be examined and monitored in multiple time course to diagnose as ACS. In fact, initial TnI showed 84.1% sensitivity but 51.2% specificity. If the combination of initial TnI and MPV were performed, the specificity of combination could increase to 75.7% and more than specificity of TnI alone. The positive predictive value (PPV) of initial TnI alone was 73.5% which was then increased to 86.7% when combined with MPV in ACS (Table 4). The probability of patients with ACS was significantly increased, while abnormal levels of both MPV and initial TnI were detected in patients (Table 5). These results were consistent with previous studies [38] , [39] , [40] and indicated that MPV is a suitable biomarker for the detection of suspected ACS patients of different races in different countries. We further demonstrated that the detection of ACS by MPV set at the cut-off of 10.55 fL is not affected by other known ACS risk factors (Table 6). Thus, we suggest that MPV be served as a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis of ACS. That is to say, when patients with acute chest pain in emergency department, measuring both initial TnI and MPV may help clinical physicians rule out non-ACS, improve accuracy for diagnosing ACS, not wait for multiple TnI detection, shorten the time of diagnosis and Door-to-Balloon Time to achieve early diagnosis of ACS.
