 In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, f(HNA) has been reported to be decreased from approximately 40% before to 30% after a dialysis session ²² . That study also noted that such a rapid alteration of redox state of serum albumin before and after dialysis resembled the alteration of serum urea nitrogen levels seen with hemodialysis treatment. Furthermore, a significant reduction in oxidized albumin ratio was reportedly observed after administration of AST-120, a carbonaceous adsorbent drug, in 5/6 nephrectomized CKD rats ²³ . In the present study, blood urea nitrogen was significantly and highly correlated with serum f(HNA). Among uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate is known to induce oxidative stress via promotion of free radical production ²⁴ . In a previous study of CKD rats, exogenous administration of indoxyl sulfate increased the ratio of oxidized albumin ²³ . Furthermore, AST-120 was found to decrease serum indoxyl sulfate levels in CKD patients receiving dialysis ²⁵ as well as pre-dialysis patients with CKD ²⁶ . Together, these findings suggest that administration of AST-120 may reduce f(HNA) in CKD patients. Nevertheless, additional longitudinal studies to confirm the effects of AST-120 on the redox state of serum album are considered to be clinically necessary.
