 Previous studies have provided information regarding the association between PLIN2 expression and ccRCC. A previous study reported that PLIN2 expression was markedly increased in cases of low-stage, low-grade or VHL alteration-positive ccRCC ( 32 ), which is consistent with the present findings. These results suggested that PLIN2 levels may represent the tumor differentiation status in ccRCC. By conducting high-density oligonucleotide microarrays on 33 ccRCC tissues and nine normal kidney samples, Yao et al ( 44 ) identified 149 significantly differentially expressed genes. When matching them with other microarray data, it was demonstrated that PLIN2 was overexpressed in both datasets. The present study observed increased levels of PLIN2 in clinical ccRCC tissues compared with in paired normal tissues. The mRNA expression levels of PLIN2 were further validated by TCGA database, which revealed significantly increased PLIN2 expression in 72 ccRCC tumor tissues compared with in paired normal tissues. In addition to validation at the protein level, IHC results demonstrated that the expression levels of PLIN2 were significantly higher in ccRCC tissues compared with in normal kidney tissues and benign renal angiomyolipoma tissues. These results demonstrated that PLIN2 may function as an oncogene, serving an important role in the tumorigenesis of ccRCC.
