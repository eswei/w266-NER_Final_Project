 Stable over-expression of WNT11 stimulates IEC6 intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, migration, and contact-independent growth [ 7 ] and increases HCT116 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [ 6 ], and WNT11 silencing reduces HCT116 cell migration [ 8 ]. In addition, the secreted protein AGR-2 (Anterior gradient protein 2 homolog) increases CRC cell migration by increasing WNT11 expression [ 9 ]. Wnt-11 activates intracellular kinases and transcription factors of the AP-1 (activator protein-1) and ATF/CREB (activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding protein) families to regulate cell motility, cell–cell interactions and tissue morphogenesis. WNT11 mRNA expression is correlated with that of FZD7, raising the possibility that FZD₇ transduces Wnt-11 signals in CRC. Consistent with this, FZD7 gene silencing reduces migration of WNT11-transfected HCT116 cells [ 6 ]. However, FZD7 gene silencing also reduces Wnt-β-catenin signaling [ 10 ] and FZD₇ is also a receptor for Wnt-3A [ 11 , 12 ], which increases CRC cell proliferation [ 13 ], and for Wnt-2B, which drives the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) [ 14 ]. Moreover, FZD₈ transduces Wnt-11 signals that promote prostate cancer cell migration, invasion and the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [ 15 ]. Thus, further studies are needed to establish which FZD receptor(s) transduce Wnt-11 signals in CRC. Similarly, there are several candidate Wnt-11 co-receptors that are overexpressed in CRC, including PTK7 [ 16 , 17 ] and ROR1 [ 18 ].
