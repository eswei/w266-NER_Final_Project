 Glycosylation exists widely in cell biological procession. O-glycosylation is essential for diverse biologic procession. However, abnormal O-glycosylation induces invasion, metastasis and recurrence of tumor [ 12 ]. The UDP-N-acetyl-Î±-D-galactosamine: poly peptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family catalyzes the initial O-linked glycosylation [ 13 ]. As a member of this family, GALNT2 is identified as an important regulator in hepatocelluar carcinoma [ 14 ] and oral carcinoma [ 15 ]. Abberant expression of GALNT3 contributes to tumor progression of lung cancer [ 16 ], gastric carcinoma [ 17 ] and CRC [ 18 ]. GALNT6 exhibits a critical role in the procession of breast cancer [ 19 ]. Moreover, the GALNT family catalyzes the active polypeptide during the formation of O-glycosylation on various proteins, including mucins [ 20 ]. Mucins are transmembrane glycoproteins majorly on the glandular or luminal epithelial cell surface, which carries plenty of O-linked glycans. Mucin1 (MUC1) exists as a heterodimeric transmembrane protein, and the aberrantly expression engages in the multiple disease evolution, including tumorigenesis. Abnormal MUC1 showed closely association with pancreatic cancer progression [ 21 ]. MUC1 was also identified as a pivotal issue for liver metastasis of CRC [ 22 ]. An overall perspective showed that GALNT3 functioned as the key enzyme catalyzed the O-glycosylated MUC1 in epithelial ovarian cancer progression [ 23 ]. However, the exactly molecular mechanism that linc01296/miR-26a/GALNT3 crosstalk mediated the CRC progression and clinical prognosis, via modifying O-glycosylated MUC1, remained unknown.
