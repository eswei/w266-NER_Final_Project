 Although the mechanisms of DNS development remain unclear, one possible mechanism is immune-mediated inflammation induced by IL-6 during the early stage of acute CO poisoning, resulting in invasive injuries in the CNS [ 11 , 13 ]. According to Ide and Kamijo [ 11 ], IL-6, one of the cytokines regulating immune reactions in the CNS and mainly secreted by microglia and astrocytes, could be a predictive marker for DNS development. Blood-brain barrier disruption by hypoxia and ischemia subject to acute CO poisoning could allow the leakage of a relatively high amount of IL-6 in the CNS to the systemic circulation [ 28 ]. In other words, the degree of brain injury by acute CO poisoning might be reflected by the serum levels of IL-6. Spinal taps to obtain CSF samples in patients with acute CO poisoning is somewhat challenging for most emergency physicians. Therefore, we hypothesized that serum levels of IL-6 in patients with DNS might be higher than those in patients without DNS. In Table 2, the median serum IL-6 level in the DNS group was 56.95 pg/mL (IQR, 160.22), which was significantly higher than that in the non-DNS group (4.45 pg/mL; IQR, 10.02) (P<0.001). This difference could be an interesting finding. However, in multiple logistic regression analysis, no correlation was found between the serum levels of IL-6 and DNS development. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess whether serum levels of IL-6 predict DNS development. However, the results of the present study may have been influenced by the following factors. The time of serum IL-6 measurement was not constant in all patients. We sampled serum IL-6 based on the time of ED admission. According to Ide and Kamijo [ 11 ], the CSF levels of IL-6 abruptly increase and swiftly return to normal levels. A one-time sampling of serum IL-6 levels at the time of ED admission might not identify elevated levels after CO injury.
