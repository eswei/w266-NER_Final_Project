 Increasing evidences have emphasized the chronic inflammation is crucial for the initiation, growth and metastasis of cancer [ 27 ]. Therefore, the roles of the inflammation related immune molecules have received great attention. The pattern recognition receptors [PRRs, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NLRs etc.], which recognize the pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) or damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and initiate the inflammatory responses, have been observed aberrantly expressed in various cancers [ 12 ]. Yang et al. reported that TLR4 was overexpressed in human breast cancer tissue and correlated with lymph node metastasis [ 28 ]. Zhou et al. found high expression of TLR5 correlated with better prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer [ 29 ]. Moreover, TLR7 and TLR9 expression was discovered to be up-regulated in human hepatic cell carcinoma tissue [ 30 ]. For NLRs, the intensity of NLRP12 immunostaining was found significantly higher in malignant prostate as compared to their adjacent benign tissues [ 31 ]. Paugh et al. found NLRP3 inflammasome upregulation and caspase-1 cleavage of the glucocorticoid receptor caused glucocorticoid resistance in leukemia cells [ 22 ]. Our previous studies also reported the abnormal expression of PRRs-TLR3 and TLR4 in OSCC [ 32 , 33 ]. In this study, we found NLRP3 was overexpressed in OSCC cells, and the expression was associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the OSCC patients. Thus we inferred that the abnormal expression of NLRP3 in OSCC was functional and went on further investigation.
