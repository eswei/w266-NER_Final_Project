 Part of PE was found to have a close correlation with FAO dysfunction. The FAO disorders were important in the pathogenesis of PE and were closely related to pathological pregnancy such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome. [¹⁴] In some patients with PE, fatty infiltration of liver and placenta and increased levels of serum triglycerides and FFA existed. [¹⁵] Minakami et al [¹⁶] performed Oil Red O staining in the liver tissue of 41 patients with PE and liver dysfunction, showing various degrees of fatty disposition in the livers of the patients. Hubel et al [¹⁷] found that compared with normal pregnancy, the serum levels of triglyceride and FFA in patients with PE increased nearly twice and were positively correlated with the concentration of lipid peroxide malondialdehyde. The exploration of the pathogenic mechanism of FAO disorders indicated the involvement of LCHAD, an important enzyme for the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Previous studies have shown that fetal LCHAD deficiency was often associated with maternal acute fatty liver or HELLP syndrome. [¹⁸] Both domestic and international studies have shown an abnormal expression of LCHAD gene in some patients with PE. A previous study found that the placental expression of LCHAD was significantly reduced in PE with liver damage, whose onset time was less than 28 weeks or 28 to 32 weeks, suggesting that the occurrence of early-onset severe PE was associated with FAO disorders. [³] This study also observed lipid deposition and decreased protein expression of LCHAD in the liver and placenta and elevated serum FFA levels in the L-NAME PE-like mouse model.
