 The occurrence and development of bladder cancer is a multi-step and multi-stage process involving the activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, and many signaling pathways. It was reported that toll-like receptor (TLR4) expression was decreased in UBC patients [ 4 ], which could activate transcription by taking part in the MyD88/MEK/STAT1 signaling pathway [ 21 ]. TLR4 is a critical molecule in the regulation of immune response and it participates in the immune escape process of UBC through up-regulation of B7H1 expression [ 4 ]. Our study also shows that B7H1 is correlated with UBC tissue specimens. B7H1 is highly expressed in isolated cancer tissues [ 22 , 23 ]. In laryngeal cancer, the expression of B7H1 was associated with the cancer grade accompanied by high expressions of CD83+CD200+ cells [ 23 ]. In urothelial cancer, B7H1 was expressed at high levels on major populations of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [ 5 ]. T cells and several cytokines have been implicated as regulators of B7H1 expression in various cancers. Cytokines produced by the host are important in immune inhibition, including TNF-α and INF-γ [ 24 , 25 ]. It was demonstrated that TNF-α and INF-γ induced PD-L1 expression by the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in lung cancer [ 25 ]. These finding suggest the B7H1 is an important factor in tumor immunological escape.
