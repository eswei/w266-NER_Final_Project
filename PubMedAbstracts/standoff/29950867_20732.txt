 It has been well established that MiRNAs are abnormally expressed in carcinogenesis. A bunch of miRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate the progression of OS proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through repressing their specific target genes. For these reasons, we suspected there could be some miRNAs involved in TRIM44 upregulation in OS. The TRIM44 transcript was predicted to be a direct target of miR-410 by bioinformatics tools, and was further confirmed by luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. There is a growing body of literature indicating the suppressive role of miR-410 in human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, and breast cancer. 25 – 28 Xiong et al have shown that miR-410 attenuates gemcitabine resistance by suppressing HMGB1-mediated autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 29 In addition, miR-410 exerts a tumor-suppressing role in breast cancer progression by downregulating oncogenic Snail. 27 Surprisingly, miR-410 also served as an oncogenic miRNA in some other types of cancer. 30 – 32 Therefore, we believe that miR-410 may play a contradictory role in tumorigenesis depending on the type of cancer. Here, we identified that miR-410 was frequently downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines, indicating that miR-410 may be implicated in OS carcinogenesis. Consistent with previous studies, we also found overexpression of miR-410 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, which mimics the cellular outcomes of TRIM44 knockdown. More intriguingly, ectopic expression of TRIM44 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-410 on OS cells. To conclude, our data indicate that TRIM44 is another main functional target gene of miR-410, and miR-410 functions as a crucial tumor suppressor in OS.
