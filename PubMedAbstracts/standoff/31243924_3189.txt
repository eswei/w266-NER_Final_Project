 Intravascular microthrombosis or extravascular compression leads to blockage of microvessels in the femoral head and ischemic necrosis. Many studies have shown that there is a tendency of coagulation and low fibrinolysis in patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head9, 10. The levels of membrane microparticles were significantly heightened after methylprednisolone treatment, which indicated that increased levels of membrane microparticles may be related to hypercoagulability, thrombosis, and inflammation in the microcirculation, and play an important role in SINFH11. Many studies have shown that α2‐macroglobulin is an important indicator for the detection of thrombotic diseases, and it plays an important role in both coagulation and fibrinolysis systems12. α2‐Macroglobulin has been found to enhance thrombin activity and to inhibit plasmin activity; that is, α2‐macroglobulin plays a role in regulating coagulation and fibrin hydrolysis13. α2‐Macroglobulin is indicated to significantly increase the regenerative capacity of plasma plasmin, while the complex formed by the binding of α2‐macroglobulin and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibits the activity of heparin, resulting in a hypercoagulable state of the blood14. Chen et al.15 confirmed that the level of α2‐macroglobulin in bone tissue of patients with steroid‐induced femoral head necrosis was significantly decreased, which may be related to the hypercoagulability of the blood, hyperlipidemia, free radicals, and degradation of matrix metalloproteinase. The inhibition of thrombin plays a particularly important role. A study included μCT and histological findings suggested that elevated α2M serum level is suitable as an indicative biomarker for early GC‐induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in rodents, and α2M plays a role in the host reparative response to GC‐associated effects16.
