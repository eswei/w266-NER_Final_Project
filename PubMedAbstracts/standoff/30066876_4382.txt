 Among the miRNA families, miR-1271 is a newly discovered member ( 17 ). Recent studies show that the impact of miR-1271 on the tumor is getting more and more attention. Many studies have found that miR-1271 has a wide range of tumor suppressor effects ( 18 – 20 ). MiR-1271 is down-regulated in many human tumors and is involved in the inhibition of tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), induction of apoptosis, and reversal of chemo-resistance ( 18 – 22 ). EMT refers to the cell under the physiological or pathological conditions into mesenchymal features similar to mesenchymal-like phenomenon. Cells lose their own cell polarity and cell-cell connections are the most important mechanism of induce tumor invasion and metastasis. The EMT of the tumor cells processed by a number of transcription factors, including ZEB1and Twist1, and these transcription factors can inhibit the expression of E-cadherin ( 23 ). Twist is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein found in recent ten years. It is an important regulatory transcription factor in the process of embryonic development. Twist is involved in the growth and development of normal organs, and it is also an important regulator of EMT in malignant tumor cells ( 24 ). E-cadherin, a member of the family of cadherin proteins in cell adhesion molecules, is an important intercellular adhesion molecule and epithelial phenotype that has been recognized as a suppressor of cancer metastasis. Tumors with reduced expression of E-cadherin are more likely to metastasize ( 25 ).
