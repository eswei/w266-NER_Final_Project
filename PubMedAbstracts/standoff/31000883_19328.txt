 Interestingly, while a 2.7 ng/ml increase in mean serum GDF15 levels (5.4 ng/ml cachexia vs. 2.7 ng/ml controls) is suspected to initiate cancer cachexia, 18 herein we detected an increase in mean serum levels of over 5 ng/ml (15.8 ng/ml HG vs. 10.5 ng/ml NVP) in patients hospitalized for HG compared to normal NVP. Serum concentrations of GDF15 in cancer patients with cachexia are significantly increased, even in the pre-cachetic state, and remain relatively steady thereafter 18 . Our findings suggest a similar upregulation of GDF15 production might be happening with HG and warrants further investigation. Levels of GDF15 (and IGFBP7) must be studied in early pregnancy to determine whether they can be used to predict an HG pregnancy. Furthermore, the brainstem-restricted receptor for GDF15, GFRAL, was recently identified and the pathway is actively being studied to identify novel therapeutic strategies for weight gain (and weight loss) 22 . Of particular clinical interest, inhibition of GDF15 restored appetite and weight gain in a mouse model of cancer cachexia 18 . If safe in pregnancy, this approach may be applicable to treating HG. Finally, the findings herein suggest an answer to an age-old paradox. HG can lead to prolonged dehydration and undernutrition, which can be detrimental to maternal and fetal health and can decrease reproductive fitness. It has been hypothesized that NVP may be beneficial to avoid food that may be toxic to the fetus 29 . Another theory is that decreased appetite leads to nutrient deficiencies that signal increased growth of the placenta to maintain early pregnancy 30 . Whether either or both are true, the dual roles of GDF15 and IGFBP7 in placentation and feeding behavior may provide a molecular explanation for why HG still exists in nature.
