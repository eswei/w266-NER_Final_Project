 In a breast cancer pilot study, MAP2K4 was recognized to be a candidate tumor suppressor [ 13 , 14 ]. Conversely, Wang et al. [ 15 ] found that MAP2K4 could act as an oncogene because it can help promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Due to the controversial evidence regarding MAP2K4, we previously investigated the expression and clinical value of MAP2K4 in invasive breast cancer [ 16 ]. The results showed that MAP2K4 is an independent predictor of outcome. Here, we further explored MAP2K4 biological functions in the regulation of breast cancer signaling pathways. On this topic, we confirmed a new mechanism for MAP2K4 in breast cancer. Different from previous ovarian cancer and lung adenocarcinoma MAP2K4 studies, we confirmed the ability of MAP2K4 to promote breast cancer cells proliferation, invasion, and migration through a series of functional in vitro and in vivo experiments, demonstrating an oncogenic role for MAP2K4 in breast cancer. Regarding the mechanism of action, our study also was the first to show that MAP2K4 overexpression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway and interacts with Vimentin in breast cancer cells. From the above results, we showed that MAP2K4 could have an oncogenic role to promote the occurrence and development of breast cancer.
