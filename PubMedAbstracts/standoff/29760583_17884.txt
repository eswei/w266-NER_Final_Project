 LncRNA PVT1 plays a role as oncogene in the development of various types of malignant tumors and shows abnormally upregulated expression. In the study of pancreatic cancer, Huang et al. found that expression level of the lncRNA PVT1 was significantly increased in cancer patients than in normal healthy controls, and the upregulated expression level of PVT1 was significantly correlated with poor prognosis of those patients [ 15 ]. In another study, expression level of PVT1 was also found to be abnormally increased in gastric cancer patients, and abnormal expression of PVT1 showed promising diagnostic and prognostic values for this disease [ 16 ]. Previous studies also confirmed that PVT1 is upregulated in cervical cancer and promote the progression of disease [ 17 â€“ 19 ]. Consistent with previous studies, in this study, expression level of PVT1 was found to be significantly higher in cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients than in normal controls. In addition, expression level of PVT1 was increased with the increased stage of primary tumor. HPV infection can induce the abnormal expression of certain lncRNAs [ 10 ]. In our study, no significant differences in serum levels of PVT1 were detected among patients infected with different HPVs and HPV-negative patients. Those data suggest that upregulated expression of PVT1 may participate in the pathogenesis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma through a HPV infection-independent pathway. Besides that, serum PVT1 also showed promising diagnostic and prognostic values for cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, PVT1 may serve as a target to improve the treatment outcomes and prognosis of those patients. It is worth to note that several lncRNAs, such as GAS5 [ 20 ] and HOTAIR [ 21 ] show clinical values for the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancers. Combination of multiple biomarkers may improve the diagnosis.
