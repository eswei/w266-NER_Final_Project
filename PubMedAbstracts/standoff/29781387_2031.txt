 As one of the most important hormone-responsive tumors, the metastasis of EC is frequently correlated with activity of estrogen signals and expression of estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) [6]. Targeted inhibition of ER has suggested a possible role in the development of novel therapy approach for EC treatment [7]. Estrogen receptor (ER)-related receptors (ERRs; ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ), which belong to the NR3B group of nuclear receptors, have high homologous DNA-binding domains with ERα [8]. Accumulating evidences indicate that orphan nuclear receptor ERR can regulate cell growth and tumorigenesis in various cancers [9]. For example, increased ERRα levels are correlated with a higher risk of recurrence and poor prognosis in breast cancer [10]. ERRα is one of the negative prognostic factors in human prostate cancer [11]. Recently, ERRα has been detected in human EC tissues and cell lines [12]. The upregulation of ERRα might be correlated with the tumor growth and advancement in uterine endometrial cancers [13]. Furthermore, expression of ERRα mRNA is positively correlated with FIGO stage (determined by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics with increasing numbers indicating the neoplastic progression, P = 0.019) and myometrial invasion (P = 0.043) of endometrial adenocarcinoma [14]. All these results suggest that ERRα is involve in the progression and metastasis of EC, while how ERRα contribute to the malignant state of EC remains unclear.
