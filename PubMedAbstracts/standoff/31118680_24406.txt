 In addition, our study further observed that MCL-1 overexpression was associated with NPM1 mutation, which was a favorable prognostic indicator in AML and frequently occurred in patients with normal karyotype. 39 In some studies, AML patients with NPM1 mutation appeared to benefit from ATRA as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy. 40 , 41 Moreover, it was reported that AML cells carrying NPM1 mutation were more sensitive to ATO, because of the expression of NPM1 mutant protein and its acquired C-terminus cysteine 288. 42 Martelli et al also showed that ATO/ATRA induced proteasome-dependent degradation of NPM1 leukemic protein leading to cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in NPM1-mutated AML. 43 Although a large number of findings suggest that the NPM1 mutation has a favorable effect on the outcome for AML. 44 â€“ 47 Falini et al found that NPM1 exon 12 mutations which caused cytoplasmic dislocation of NPM were related to the malignant clone and leukemogenesis. 48 Moreover, a study conducted by Konoplev et al suggested that NPM1 mutations did not impact OS and event-free survival (EFS) in AML patients. 49 However, Verhaak et al demonstrated that patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk AML with NPM1 mutations had a significantly better OS and EFS than those without NPM1 mutations. 44 Further studies are needed to confirm and reveal the underlying association between MCL-1 expression and NPM1 mutation.
