 We further investigated the clinical significance of KRT18, and observed high KRT18 expression was positively associated with clinical stage, tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and degree of differentiation. In lung cancer patients, KRT18 expression was suggested to be correlated with clinical lymph node metastasis [ 25 ]. In addition, KRT18 expression had 4.6-times increase in high metastatic lung cancer cell line compared with low metastatic lung cancer cell line [ 26 ]. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients, levels of KRT18 expression were positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and aggressive phenotype [ 27 , 28 ]. Moreover, Afrem et al. [ 29 ] reported KRT18 overexpression was correlated with advanced clinical stage, poor differentiation, and high invasion pattern in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients. In bladder cancer, Wild et al. [ 20 ] and Catto et al. [ 30 ] conformably found KRT18 served as one of artificial intelligence-selected genes for predicting clinical progression. Moreover, Yin et al. [ 31 ] suggested high expression of KRT18 was associated with tumor aggressiveness and paclitaxel resistance in prostate cancer patients. In breast cancer, Chalabi et al. [ 32 ] revealed that high expression of KRT18 often observed in luminal B patients from Lebanon, Tunisia, and Morocco, and in luminal A patients from France. Besides, Kilic-Baygutalp et al. [ 17 ] found KRT18 expression was positively associated with clinical stage, tumor stage, and metastasis stage in patients with esophageal cancer. In gastric cancer, high KRT18 expression was suggested to be associated with positive lymph nodes, advanced clinical stage, and chemoresistance [ 33 , 34 ].
