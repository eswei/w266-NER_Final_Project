 In some cases of cardiac diseases, electrical remodeling, such as alterations in ion channels or Ca²⁺ cycling, precedes the observed depression of mechanical performance, suggesting that amelioration of electrical remodeling might be an effective therapeutic strategy against HF ( Houser and Margulies, 2003 ; Mueller et al., 2011 ). KATP is reportedly involved in ventricular remodeling, and KATP channel agonists exert beneficial effects on cardiac structural remodeling and dysfunction ( Lee et al., 2008 ; Sun et al., 2015 ). IK₁ and KATP channels are both members of inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channel family and are respectively constituted by Kir2.x and Kir6.x subunits ( Hibino et al., 2010 ). Prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and downregulation of IK₁ channel are well documented hallmarks of electrical remodeling in HF ( Janse, 2004 ). Inhibition of IK₁ also contributes to APD prolongation. Besides, IK₁ is reduced by elevated diastolic Ca²⁺ in HF ( Fauconnier et al., 2005 ). Therefore, IK₁ channel is probably involved in cardiac remodeling, and IK₁ channel agonism or up-regulation may improve cardiac structure and dysfunction.
