 Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy in women worldwide with nearly 234,190 new cases in the United States in 2015 (Siegel et al., 2015[ 37 ]). Estrogens have an important role in the development of BC and exert their effects by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Two forms of human ER gene have been identified; ERα (Walter et al., 1985[ 39 ]), which was the first to be recognized, and ERβ (Mosselman et al., 1996[ 29 ]). The ERs are expressed in 60-70 % of BCs (Lim et al., 2012[ 25 ]) and ERα seems to be the predominant form (Martin et al., 1991[ 28 ]); therefore, targeting of ER is a suitable strategy for management of ER-positive BCs, and antiestrogens like tamoxifen which are used for BC therapy act through ER targeting. Although most ER-positive BCs initially respond to tamoxifen therapy, tamoxifen-resistant tumors eventually develop (Johnston, 1997[ 18 ]). This is thought to result from growth factor-induced ERα activity through activation of protein kinases resulting in phosphorylation of ERα (Katzenellenbogen et al., 1997[ 20 ]). Serine 118 (Ser118) and 167 (Ser167) are two important residues of ERα which have been indicated to be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT), respectively, and appear to be mostly related to BC resistance to tamoxifen (de Leeuw et al., 2011[ 12 ]). These residues can also be phosphorylated by several other kinases including CDK7, IKKα, GSK3β, EGFR and RET which have been shown to be responsible for phosphorylation of ERα at Ser118. p90 RSK1, casein kinase II, and RET phosphorylate ERα at Ser167 (Murphy et al., 2011[ 30 ]).
