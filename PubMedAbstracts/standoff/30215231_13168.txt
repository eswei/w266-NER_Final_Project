 Importantly, our results showed that the frequencies of the C allele, the homozygous CC genotype, and the heterozygous CT genotype in miR-196a2 were significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC patients than in controls. In contrast, the frequencies of the T allele and the homozygous TT genotype were significantly lower in HBV-positive HCC patients than in controls. Our results showed that inheritance of the miR-196a2 C allele and the CC and CT genotypes may increase the risk of HCC in HBV-positive patients by affecting the expression of mature miR-196a2 and HOXC8, thereby enhancing cell migration/invasion. Our results provide evidence that the miR-196a2 polymorphism may be an indicator of HCC susceptibility in HBV-positive patients. Xu et al. [ 25 ] evaluated the relationship between the miR-196a2 SNP and the risk of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. They revealed that inheritance of the homozygous CC genotype of miR-196a2 was associated with higher miR-196a2 expression than inheritance of the TT genotype. Polymorphisms in pre-miR-196a-2 have been associated with HCC susceptibility in a Turkish population [ 26 ]. Other studies have also demonstrated the relationship between this SNP and other cancers. For example, Song et al. [ 27 ] showed that individuals who inherited the CC genotype were more susceptible to epithelial ovarian cancer than those who inherited the TT or CT genotype. With the finding of increased expression of mature miR-196a in patients with the C allele, they concluded that the miR-196a2 CC genotype may increase the risk of ovarian cancer [ 27 ].
