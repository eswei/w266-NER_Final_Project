 Given the profound loss of plaque-associated macrophages in TREM2-deficient amyloid mice, myeloid cell survival and proliferation were of interest in these models. It has been shown that TREM2-deficient mice have dramatically decreased numbers of proliferating plaque-associated macrophages as measured by proliferation markers Ki67, and BrdU in aging APPPS1 and 5XFAD mice [146] , [151] . In addition, it was shown by the Colonna lab that TREM2 deficiency results in increased cleaved caspase-3 activation, resulting in enhanced myeloid cell death [151] . Utilizing super resolution microscopy, Yuan et al. further demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of TREM2 in mice or humans harboring the R47H mutation results in altered plaque compaction with much more diffuse and fibrillar plaques present, and fewer thioflavin S⁺ dense core plaques [152] . In this situation, more neurotoxic oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ may be present leading to increased neuronal dystrophy and death. Along with plaque compaction issues, microglia and macrophages lacking TREM2 have been shown to have decreased capacity to phagocytose and clear Aβ, apoptotic cells, as well as other proteins and complexes [131] , [153] , [154] . TREM2-deficient myeloid cells also exhibit increased numbers of autophagy-associated phagolysosomes reflective of aberrant mTOR activation resulting in dysregulated metabolic homeostasis within the context of Aβ pathology [155] .
