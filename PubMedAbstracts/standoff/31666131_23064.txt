 The mass spectrometry results further confirmed that − 1164 upstream region of hMSH2, a transcription factor Mef-2, HNFα, and GR binding site (<url>), was hypermethylated in patients with platinum resistance. We also discovered that the hMSH2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated in patients with platinum resistance. Correlation analysis suggested that the methylation level of − 1164 CpG site was associated with hMSH2 mRNA expression. These findings indicated that loss of expression due to hypermethylation of hMSH2 upstream region might induce platinum resistance in EOC patients. In the earlier literature hypermethylation of another essential MMR gene, hMLH1 was observed in cisplatin-resistant EOC patients [ 25 , 26 ]. While whether loss of hMSH2 expression caused by hypermethylation of hMSH2 promoter contributed to platinum resistance or not in EOC was unclear previously. The results from our study provided the evidence firstly that hypermethylation of the hMSH2 upstream region could be another mechanism for the platinum resistance in EOC patients. Interestingly, a slight increase of hMLH1 methylation level was also observed in the platinum-resistant patients compared to the sensitive patients in our study based on the RRBS analysis. However, the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. Indeed, there are few pieces of previous literature reporting the correlation between hMLH1 methylation and platinum resistance based on customized or commercially available methylation array or next-generation sequence (NGS)-based platforms. What is more, none of those studies reported a clear relationship between the hMLH1 methylation and drug resistance [ 27 – 29 ]. Much more need to be done in the future.
