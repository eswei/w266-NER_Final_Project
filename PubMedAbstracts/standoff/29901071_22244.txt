 Curcumin has been described to exhibit antineoplastic properties in various types of cancer, including the inhibition of cell growth and metastasis, and promotion of apoptosis, via interacting with numerous cell signaling molecules ( 28 , 34 ). Kamat et al found that curcumin enhanced the antitumor effects of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin on BC by reducing NF-κB and inducing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors ( 35 ). Curcumin has been found to inhibit cell proliferation and invasive ability and trigger apoptosis by the suppression of Skp2 and induction of p21 in pancreatic cancer cells ( 27 ). Curcumin enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by disrupting AMP-activated protein kinase/Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase-dependent autophagy and inducing apoptotic death in colon cancer cells ( 36 ). Curcumin inhibits cell growth through increasing p21 and p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and inhibiting cyclin D1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling ( 37 ). YAP/TAZ are markedly suppressed by curcumin treatment, and the expression of Notch-1 is also suppressed ( 38 ). Curcumin triggers the degradation of KLF5 by the suppression of YAP/TAZ in BC cells ( 30 ). It has been reported that curcumin inhibits the mobility of BC cells through modulating the level of β-catenin and abrogating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ( 39 ). In the present study, curcumin notably inhibited BC cell growth, invasion and migration, and triggered apoptotic cell death and G2/M phase arrest (Figs. 1 and 2A and B). These findings suggested the therapeutic possibility of curcumin for treating BC. Furthermore, it was found that Trop2 was a target of curcumin in the BC cell lines.
