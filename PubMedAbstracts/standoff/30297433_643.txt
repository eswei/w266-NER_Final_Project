 Damage to intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers during intestinal inflammation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Here we show that the endoribonuclease Regnase-1 controls colon epithelial regeneration by regulating protein kinase mTOR (the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) and purine metabolism. During dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal epithelial injury and acute colitis, Regnase-1∆ᴵᴱC mice, which lack Regnase-1 specifically in the intestinal epithelium, were resistant to body weight loss, maintained an intact intestinal barrier, and showed increased cell proliferation and decreased epithelial apoptosis. Chronic colitis and tumor progression were also attenuated in Regnase-1∆ᴵᴱC mice. Regnase-1 predominantly regulates mTORC1 signaling. Metabolic analysis revealed that Regnase-1 participates in purine metabolism and energy metabolism during inflammation. Furthermore, increased expression of ectonucleotidases contributed to the resolution of acute inflammation in Regnase-1∆ᴵᴱC mice. These findings provide evidence that Regnase-1 deficiency has beneficial effects on the prevention and/or blocking of intestinal inflammatory disorders.
