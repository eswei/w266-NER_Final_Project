 The inverse association between LDL-C level and DM among participants with desirable LDL-C concentration may be related to statin therapy. Statin therapy was associated with a 9% increased risk of incident DM, with the effect being stronger in older individuals [ 6 ]. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) increases the expression of LDL receptors in many tissues and promotes transmembrane cholesterol transport. This alteration in cholesterol transport may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes [ 19 ]. Nevertheless, after stratifying by the use of statin, multivariable logistic regression found that the relationship between DM and LDL-C was not affected by statins. Genetic studies have shown that the incidence of new-onset DM is associated with low LDL-C levels [ 19 , 20 ], which are consistent with a previous finding that patients with familial hypercholesterolemia were less likely to have type 2 diabetes [ 21 ]. In addition, overexpression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an inhibitor of the LDL-C transporter, may suppress gluconeogenesis. In contrast, inhibiting NPC1L1 by ezetimibe, a lipid-lowering agent, may increase gluconeogenesis [ 22 ].
