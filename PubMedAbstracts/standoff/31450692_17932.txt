 Elevated lipid levels in plasma have been shown to play a role in several human diseases, and could also be related to cognitive decline. Initial studies failed to find an association between plasma lipids and MCI [ 59 ]. In 2012, Yin et al. revealed that triglycerides (TG) were negatively associated with MCI, and could preserve cognitive decline in the elderly. This study did not find any association between cholesterol and cognitive impairment [ 60 ]. In 2016, He et al. analyzed the total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels in patients with MCI compared with healthy individuals. This study found higher TC levels in MCI individuals compared with controls; however, this finding may be contradictory. Previously, other studies revealed that high TC might have a protective effect against AD or cognitive impairment. This study observed reduced HDL-C in MCI patients, suggesting that HDL-C can prevent amyloid aggregation and cognitive impairment. A similar association was found between plasma TG levels and MCI, suggesting that TG may also have a protective effect [ 61 ]. The relationship between TGs and amyloid-β may be explained through role of TGs in the peripheral lipoprotein transport of Aβ. Further studies are required to investigate the biomarker.
