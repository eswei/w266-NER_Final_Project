 We observed reduced miR-181a expression was in ABC-type DLBCL cells, whereas miR-181b expression was similar in ABC and GCB cell lines. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that exogenous overexpression of miR-181a significantly inhibited tumor growth by inhibiting CARD11. CARD11 is the only lymphocyte-specific member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family that acts at the intersection of the BCR and TCR signaling pathways. CARD11 was mutated and highly expressed in ABC DLBCL, which further activated the NF-ÎºB pathway leading to increased nuclear transcription of various target genes including BCL2, API2, and BCLX [ 23 ]. In a Middle Eastern population, high CARD11 mRNA and protein expression were related to the prognosis of DLBCL [ 24 ]. Shigeo et al. found that the overexpression of CARD11 and CARD9 was associated with gastric B lymphoma [ 25 ]. Ngo et al. performed loss of function screen of 2500 genes in DLBCL and found that CARD11, MALT1, and BCL-10 were critical genes for tumor cell survival and proliferation with CARD11 playing a key role in ABC-DLBCL [ 26 ]. Moreover, higher CARD11 mRNA levels were observed in ABC-DLBCL biopsy specimens than that in GCB-DLBCL specimens. It was postulated that CARD11 enabled cell survival through BCL10-dependent IKK activation in ABC-DLBCL. Furthermore, since CARD11 is only expressed in lymphoid tissues, it is an attractive therapeutic target for ABC-DLBCL [ 27 ].
