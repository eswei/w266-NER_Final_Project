 Previously studies have reported that ET-1 modulates renal arteriolar tone via generation of O₂.− [ 38 ]. Our study confirmed that metabolism of O₂.− with PEG-SOD reduced ET-1 responses in both control and diabetic mice. Afferent arteriolar levels of O₂.− were increased significantly by ET-1 at 10−⁷mol·l−¹ in arterioles from both normal and diabetic mice. Thus, generation of O₂.− contributes to ET-1 induced arteriolar contractions in both normal and diabetic mouse arterioles. Compared to O₂.−, H₂O₂ has been reported variously to exert vasoconstriction or vasodilation depending on experimental conditions [ 5 , 39 ], We confirmed our previous report that 10−⁵ mol·l−¹ of H₂O₂ vasodilates normal afferent arterioles [ 19 ]. In contrast, we now report that H₂O₂ exerts a steady and sustained contraction of afferent arterioles from diabetic mice. The mechanisms of these different effects are unclear. The possible mediators are increased contractile protein expression [ 40 ] or decreased potassium channels protein [ 6 , 41 ]. We confirmed that metabolism of H₂O₂ with PEG-catalase did not affect contractions of arterioles from normal mice [ 7 ], However, PEG-catalase markedly reduced the responsiveness to ET-1 in arterioles from diabetic mice. Increased H₂O₂ was related to diabetes rather than ET-1 since it was found in diabetic arterioles under basal condition and was not increased even by 10−⁷ mol·l−¹ of ET-1. This is the first report that increased ROS generated by diabetes, especially H₂O₂, are responsible for the increased responses to ET-1.
