 Next, we also found that serum CCL11 levels are strongly related to the clinical severity defined by VAS and ODI, implicating that CCL11 may be involved in the process inflammatory and neuropathic pain in OP. The two scales including VAS and ODI are most frequently used measurements of low back pain and functional ability in OP patients, and the psychometric properties of both the VAS and ODI have been shown to be valid and reliable in OP patients ( 27 , 28 ). Bone pain is the most common complaint in OP patients leading to impaired quality of life. Studies have identified that both peripheral and central components participate in the bone pain in OP patients ( 29 ). In elderly OP patients, there has been an increased density of bone sensory nerve fibres along with enhanced expressions of nociceptors sensitised by the lowering pH result from the osteoclastic activity ( 29 ). Meanwhile, during the OP process, the bone sensory nerve fibres may undergo pathological modifications ( 30 ). The role of CCL11 in pain production and maintenance has been investigated before. Previous studies have identified that CCL11 was involved in many pathological processes of pain-related diseases. Gul E et al. ( 31 ) found that CCL11 levels were significantly higher in patients with primary dysmenorrhea than the control subjects. In another study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of gene CCL11 served as a marker for the disease of fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome ( 32 ). In addition, higher levels of CCL11 were found in neuropathic pain cohorts compared with healthy controls, pointing to the role of CCL11 in neuro-inflammation ( 33 ).
