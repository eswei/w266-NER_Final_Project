 Recently, pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukins (IL)-6 and IL-8 have been suggested to play roles in the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer ( 29 ). IL-6 has reportedly been correlated with TNBC progression, and clinical studies have shown increased IL-8 levels in aggressive breast tumor tissue when compared with normal breast tissue ( 30 , 31 ). Due to the importance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in TNBC invasion, in-depth study is needed to validate a better target for inflammatory signaling. Our recent studies have shown that IL-6 and IL-8 are produced through a BLT2-dependent pathway ( 6 , 32 ) (Fig. 1). Kim et al. found that BLT2 expression was increased in human TNBC cell lines, human TNBC MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells when compared with its expression in a human breast cancer cell line, MCF-10A. Therefore, we examined whether BLT2 can reduce the invasiveness and secretion of IL-8. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with a specific BLT2 antagonist LY255283 or transfected with BLT2 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In these experiments, we demonstrated that IL-8 secretion, invasiveness in TNBC cells, and lung invasion in a TNBC xenograft mouse model are regulated in a BLT2-dependent manner. Park et al. also demonstrated that IL-6/IL-8 is downstream of the BLT2-dependent pathway in LPS-treated TNBC cell lines and an MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. The activity of NF-κB is up-regulated in TNBC, and the NF-κB signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the invasiveness of TNBC. In TNBC, NF-κB signaling cascades, which are related to invasion, are regulated by the BLT2-NOX-1 pathway, leading to the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in TNBC (Fig. 1). Together, these observations suggest that BLT2 plays a critical role in TNBC cell invasion and metastasis via IL-6/IL-8 up-regulation.
