 Several recent studies support this idea. First, postmortem evidence from patients with schizophrenia has revealed reductions in the levels of two activity-dependent markers in TRN GABAergic neurons, the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) and extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets ¹⁴ . Furthermore, mutations in the crystallin βB2 gene associated with schizophrenia reduce TRN-PV neuron density and are associated with schizophrenia-like impairment in pre-pulse inhibition ¹⁵ . Finally, genetic studies ¹⁶ , ¹⁷ have implicated CACNAI1, a gene encoding the low-threshold calcium channel CaV3.3 which is highly expressed in TRN and responsible for the rebound burst discharge in TRN neurons during sleep ¹⁸ , as a schizophrenia risk gene. Another recent study showed that deletion of the schizophrenia-associated gene, ErbB4, from TRN somatostatin (SOM) neurons impairs sensory selection in mice ¹⁹ . These findings suggest that TRN GABA/PV and GABA/SOM neurons, like their cortical counterparts ²⁰ , may exhibit reduced activity in schizophrenic patients. However, whether changes in the activity of TRN neurons can account for cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities in this disease is unclear.
