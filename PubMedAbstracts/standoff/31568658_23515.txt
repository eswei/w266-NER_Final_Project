 Our current results also demonstrated that LCN2 deletion attenuates the occurrence of T2 hyperintensities, BBB disruption, oligodendrocyte loss, and myelin degradation in the hyperacute (4 hours) phase after SAH. LCN2 deficiency has also been found to reduce BBB disruption and neuroinflammation and oxidative stress at 24 hours after ICH, thrombin induced hydrocephalus and SAH.8, 21, 22 The exact mechanisms by which LCN2 is involved in BBB disruption, oligodendrocyte injury, and myelin damage are still unclear. Some studies on ischemic stroke have proposed a hypoxia—HIF‐1α‐LCN2—vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A axis signaling mechanism.23 The HIF‐1α‐LCN2 signaling pathway plays an important role in cancer and acute kidney injury.24, 25 SAH causes a hypoxic state in acute phase due to elevated ICP and decreased CBF.2 Numerous studies have reported that HIF‐1α is expressed in brain in rat models of SAH.26, 27, 28 VEGFA is a potent regulator of endothelial permeability and disruption of the hypoxia—HIF‐1 α‐LCN2—VEGFA axis may help preserve BBB permeability. Furthermore, the current study found that oligodendrocytes express the LCN2 receptor, 24p3R as well as LCN2 itself. LCN2 via its receptor may be involved in cellular iron uptake after hemorrhage potentially causing iron toxicity.21 Alternately, 24p3R was also expressed on microglial cells suggesting that LCN2 may have a role in SAH‐induced neuroinflammation. However, recent studies showed that endothelial cells also can express 24p3R29 and LCN2 may help to maintain BBB integrity in brain ischemia.30
