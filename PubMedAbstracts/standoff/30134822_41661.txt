 Conclusions In conclusion, our study provides an insight into the potential role of EGFR in advanced and invasive PCa possibly by acting as an upstream regulator of AR via the PI3K/AKT axis in growth and survival while likely acting through distinct pathways in invasive mechanisms. The study also provides a clue about the communication between the EGFR/AR axis and MMP-9, which might be a crucial component of tumor dissemination and establishment at the metastatic sites.
