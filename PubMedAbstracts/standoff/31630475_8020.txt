 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals, reagents, and antibodies All reagents and materials were purchased in Australia except when indicated. Cell culture reagents were sourced from Gibco (ThermoFisher, North Ryde, Australia) and chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma (Castle Hill, Australia) except when specified. Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: anti‐KLK14 catalytic domain antibody (Triple Point Biologics, Forest Grove, OR, USA), anti‐beta actin and anti‐GAPDH (mouse monoclonal; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti‐KLK3/PSA (rabbit polyclonal; Dako, North Sydney, Australia), anti‐agrin (AGRN; rabbit polyclonal; ThermoFisher), anti‐phospho Erk1/2 (Tyr202/204, rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology, Genesearch, Arundel, Australia), anti‐Erk1/2 (mouse monoclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), anti‐phospho Mek1/2 (Ser217/221, rabbit monoclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), anti‐Mek1/2 (mouse monoclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti‐GFP (mouse monoclonal; Abcam). Goat anti‐mouse IgG Alexa Fluor‐680, goat anti‐rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor‐680, goat anti‐rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor‐488, and Alexa Fluor‐647 Phalloidin were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Seventeen Mile Rocks, Australia). Recombinant human KLK14 (2626‐SE), purified thermolysin (3097‐ZN), recombinant human AGRN (6624‐AG), recombinant human desmoglein‐2 (DSG2; 947‐DM), and recombinant human cystatin‐C (CST3; 1196‐PI) were purchased from R&D Systems (In Vitro Technologies, Noble Park, Australia).
