 rs438811 confers risk in APOE ε4 carriers predominantly We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify eQTLs which can confer AD risk in the 34 proxy eQTLs for APOE. After adjustment for age and gender, substantia nigra eQTL rs438811 (odds ratio [OR], 2.343; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.205–2.490; raw P-value = 7.49 × 10−¹⁶⁷) was associated with AD (Table 2). After adjustment for age, gender and APOE ε4 status, rs438811 (OR, 1.049; 95% CI, 0.969–1.135; P-value = 0.237) was not associated with AD (Table 2). After introducing interaction item rs438811 genotype × APOE ε4 status into the model, rs438811 was found can confer AD risk by interacting with APOE ε4 status strongly (OR, 1.448; 95% CI, 1.231–1.704; P-value = 7.94 × 10−⁶; Table 3). Sub-group analysis showed rs438811 confer risk predominantly in APOE ε4 carriers (OR, 1.267; 95% CI, 1.124–1.430; P-value = 1.12 × 10−⁴; Table 3), which indicates carrying one minor allele T of rs438811 can increase the opportunity of developing to AD by 26.75% in APOE ε4 carriers. As shown in BRAINEAC, minor allele T of rs438811 was associated with increased APOE expression level in substantia nigra. The APOE eQTL P-values of rs438811 across the ten different brain regions were shown in Table S2. Table 2 Substantia nigra eQTL rs438811 for APOE identified as a susceptibility locus for AD.

By querying Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), rs438811 was found to be target of transcription factors POLR2A and RPC155. rs483082, a brain eQTL for APOE which is in complete linkage with rs438811 and was also identified can interact with APOE ε4 status to confer AD risk in this study, was the target of multiple transcription factors: HNF4G, CEBPB, MXI1, HDAC2, SP1, RFX5, MAX, EP300, JUND, FOSL2, ZBTB7A and CEBPD. rs483082 was also found be to located in a DNase I hypersensitivity cluster.
