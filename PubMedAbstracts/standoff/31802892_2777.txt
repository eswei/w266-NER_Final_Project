 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class >200 nucleotides (nt) and have no translation function. Previous documents revealed that lncRNAs closely associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional modulation and further affect cancer. 4 Long intergenic non-coding RNA 152 (LINC00152), an 828 bp lncRNA located on human chromosome 2p11.2, was discovered in the process of demethylation during liver cancer progression. 5 Plenty of evidence indicated that LINC00152 was an oncogene in various malignancies including ESCC. 6 For example, a study in gastric cancer (GC) demonstrated that LINC00152 was apparently upregulated in GC tissues and cells, and LINC00152 depletion retarded cell proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis. 7 Actually, another document unraveled that LINC00152 was significantly increased in ESCC tissues and cells (EC109, EC9706, TE-1, TE-3, KYSE150, YSE450 and KYSE30), LINC00152 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis via miR-153-3p/FYN axis in ESCC. 8 However, the full regulatory network of LINC00152 in ESCC remains to be determined.
