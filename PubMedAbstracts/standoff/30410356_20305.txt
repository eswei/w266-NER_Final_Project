 Similar to the previous research, our data demonstrated the significant prognostic value of ECOG PS in the NSCLC patients. Moreover, a correlation between decreased serum ApoA-I level and poorer ECOG PS (2–4) was found in our study. Weaker general physical condition is always related with poorer ECOG PS score (2–4), which generally accompanies hypoalbuminemia. So it can be better understood that ApoA-I levels were found to be lower in patients with albumin ≤35 g/L before initial treatment. Furthermore, clinical TNM stage and extent of metastasis have also been explored with lung cancer patients in our study. Pretherapy serum ApoA-I levels were found to be lower in patients with more organ sites of distant metastasis compared with those with less than two sites of metastasis. We also observed that elevated ApoA-I levels were related to an earlier TNM stage in NSCLC patients. Recent study has revealed that ApoA-I has been related to the metastasis and angiogenesis by changing the tumor microenvironment. Decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein levels and enzyme activity combined with extracellular matrix remodeling promote tumor invasion and tumor metastasis, which might provide a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. 17
