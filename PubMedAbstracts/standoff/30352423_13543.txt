 Discussion A few cases of CAH-associated adrenal myelolipoma have been reported previously with most of them caused by 21-OH deficiency. The second most common cause was 17-OH deficiency ( 11 ). In the current report, two patients in family 1 presented with CAH-associated giant adrenal myelolipomas secondary to 21-OH deficiency caused by a compound heterozygous mutation (c.293-13C>G/c.518T>A, p.I173N). Three patients in family 2 presented with CAH-associated adrenal myelolipomas because of 17-OH deficiency resulting from a compound heterozygous mutation (c.1118A>T, p.H373L/c.1459_1467del9, p.D487_F489del). All the four mutations have been reported to be associated with CAH, respectively ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ). However, no adrenal myelolipoma was found with single mutations. Here, we firstly described these two compound heterozygous mutations in two unrelated families and found that only these compound heterozygous mutations, but not the single mutation, in the CYP genes can result in adrenal myelolipomas.
