 Several genes involved in maintaining and monitoring genomic stability have emerged as breast cancer (BC) susceptibility genes. High-throughput methods have allowed identification of variants associated with breast cancer in more than 20 genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair [ 2 ]. BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 are known breast cancer predisposition genes. Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have been detected in 20% of families with a history of breast cancer in Poland. Polish founder mutations (5382insC, C61G and 4153delA) are reported to be responsible for nearly 90% of BRCA1 mutations [ 3 , 4 ]. Furthermore, variants of CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2 + 1G/A, del5395bp, and I157T), PALB2 (509_510delGA and 172_175delTTGT) and RECQL (c.1667_1667 + 3delAGTA) are also associated with breast cancer in the Polish population. Patients with CHEK2 mutations have a greater-than-25% risk of breast cancer [ 5 , 6 ]. The presence of PALB2 mutations is associated with increased breast cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30 to 8.37; P < 0.0001) [ 7 ]. Moreover, a mutation in the RECQL gene is associated with a 5.5-fold increase in the risk of breast cancer in Poland [ 8 ]. In addition, individuals with certain rare genetic syndromes, such as Peutz-Jeghers (caused by STK11 mutations, where the risk of BC is 45% by the age of 70) or Li-Fraumeni (caused by TP53 mutations, with a BC relative risk of 6.4Ã—), have an increased risk of breast cancer [ 9 , 10 ].
