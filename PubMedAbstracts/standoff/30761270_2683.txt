 Retinal determination gene network (RDGN), mainly including dachshund (DACH), sine oculis (SIX) and eyes absent (EYA), governs organ development ( 11 ). EYA family members, including EYA1, EYA2, EYA3, and EYA4, contain a C-terminal 271 amino-acid region for the interaction with other proteins and a N-terminal domain responsible for the innate immune response with inherent threonine phosphorylation activity ( 12 – 14 ). Recently, the dysregulation of EYA2 has been reported to be involved in several human cancers ( 15 – 18 ). For instance, EYA2 expression was enhanced in multiple tumors in comparison with corresponding normal tissues ( 16 , 17 ). EYA2 can promote tumor growth in diverse tumor types ( 16 – 19 ). In human astrocytoma, EYA2 promoted cell cycle progression of tumor cells via the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E ( 17 ). Knockdown of EYA2 by siRNA reduced the proliferation through cell cycle G1 block and enhanced the apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells ( 20 ). On the contrary, one previous research demonstrated that EYA2 overexpression was an unfavorable molecule for tumor growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in orthotopic models ( 21 ). In addition, EYA2 can also contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis for some cancer types, including breast cancer ( 18 ), lung adenocarcinoma ( 22 ), and astrocytoma ( 17 ). Several mechanisms might underlie the role of EYA2 in tumor invasion, including the activation of ERK signaling ( 17 ) and the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ( 18 ). The association between EYA2 and clinical outcomes is controversial. High EYA2 level has been demonstrated to be a negative element for prognosis in lung cancer ( 16 ), while EYA2 predicted better clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer ( 15 ) and pancreatic cancer ( 21 ).
