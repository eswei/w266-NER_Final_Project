 Previous studies have found that CAV2 is associated with the occurrence and development of tumors. The expression of CAV2 has been observed in 5.9% of all breast cancer, while CAV2 expression has been reported as being strongly associated with high histological grade. 13 CAV2 is mainly expressed in breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. 14 However, another study found that CAV2 expression is suppressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and that the reduced CAV1 is significantly associated with increasing tumor size. 15 Another study has suggested that there is a correlation between plasma CAV2 levels and progression of prostate cancer. 16 CAV2 can promote tumor growth by supporting tumor-induced angiogenesis. Because of this function of CAV2 in tumor microenvironment, CAV2 is regarded as a potentially novel target for lung cancer therapy. 28 In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the increased expression of CAV2 correlates with a tumor progression and poor prognosis. So, CAV2, which has been shown to correlate with RCC, 17 is a potential biomarker for diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 29 However, the expression and function of CAV2 is not known in RCC. Our results revealed that CAV2 had increased expression in RCC. The increased expression of CAV2 was associated with cancer progression. CAV2 high expression was significantly correlated with poor OS in all patients with invasive RCC. Silencing of CAV2 caused reduction in cell proliferation and growth with retarded entry into the S phase. 30 Our data revealed that silencing CAV2 inhibited the cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in RCC. Our results furthermore indicated that high expression of CAV2 promoted the progression of RCC.
