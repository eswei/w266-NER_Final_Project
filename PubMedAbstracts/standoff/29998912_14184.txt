 Impaired TG-rich lipoprotein metabolism under the condition of disturbance of ABCG5/ABCG8 have been implicated by the observational and interventional studies of sitosterolemic subjects ¹⁴ , ¹⁵ ⁾ as well as by the experimental study using ABCG5/ABCG8 knockout mice (sitosterolemic mice) ¹⁶ ⁾. Previously, we demonstrated that breastfed infantile cases with sitosterolemia harboring double mutations in ABCG5 gene exhibit transient extreme hyper-LDL cholesterolemia ⁹ ⁾. In addition, there have been great diversities in the LDL-C levels among the subjects with sitosterolemia described so far ¹⁷ ⁾. Such observations as well as the facts that ABCG5/ABCG8 are playing an important role in excretion of sterols in the intestine could lead us to investigate if the patients with sitosterolemia harboring ABCG5/ABCG8 mutations are vulnerable to diet-induced hyperlipidemia. We confirmed that post-prandial RLP metabolism was disturbed in the patients with sitosterolemia for the first time. Moreover, apoB48 level, which has been shown to be associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases ¹⁸ ⁾, was significantly elevated in sitosterolemic patients both in fasting state, as well as in postprandial state. In addition, we observed that the peaks of the post-prandial lipoproteins were earlier in sitosterolemic patients than those in heterozygous FH. Moreover, sitosterol level in sitosterolemic patients increased after fat load, although such trends were not observed in heterozygous FH nor in single mutation carriers. Thus, dietary counseling for the patients with sitosterolemia should be one of the reasonable approaches for their risk management.
