 The development of diabetes is associated with the occurrence of a series of complications ( 16 , 17 ). Previous studies suggested that lncRNAs are key factors in the development of diabetic complications. Sun et al ( 16 ) reported that lncRNA Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4-intron region (Erbb4-IR) was upregulated in a mouse model of diabetic kidney injury, and that the upregulation of lncRNA Erbb4-IR is closely associated with disease progression. A study by Zhuo et al ( 17 ) revealed that lncRNA H19 is downregulated in diabetic cardiomyopathy and overexpression of lncRNA H19 inhibits autophagy by epigenetically silencing DIRAS family GTPase 3. However, most lncRNAs involved in diabetic complications are regulated by high glucose and have no diagnostic value to distinguish patients with a specific diabetic complication from diabetic patients without this complication ( 16 , 17 ). lncRNA-SRA has pivotal roles in different types of human disease. Genetic variants of lncRNA SRA have been proved to be closely associated with the risk of breast cancer ( 10 ). lncRNA-SRA also inhibits the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase, thereby promoting hepatic steatosis ( 11 ). However, the involvement of lncRNA-SRA in diabetic cardiovascular disease has remained elusive. It has been reported that lncRNA-SRA promotes the proliferation of VSMCs, which have pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases ( 12 , 13 ). The present study demonstrated that the plasma levels of lncRNA-SRA may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for type II diabetic cardiovascular disease. However, the expression of lncRNA-SRA has been reported to be affected by multiple diseases. Therefore, the diagnostic specificity should be further investigated.
