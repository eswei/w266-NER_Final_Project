 Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that PO₂, FEV₁, and miR-190a-5p expression were independent risk factors of all-cause mortality in patients with COPD-PH. In addition, lower levels of miR-190a-5p were predictive of event-free survival in the COPD-PH subgroup, but not in the global PH group; this indicates that miR-190a-5p has a unique prognostic value in COPD-PH. COPD-related PH has been classified as group 3 “pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia,” 28 which suggests that exposure to hypoxic conditions plays a more important role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of COPD-PH than in other types of PH. This is an important reason why the circulating level of miR-190a-5p shows an independent prognostic value in patients with COPD-PH, but not in the global cohort of patients with PH. In addition, miR-190a-5p shows a negative correlation with KLF15 mRNA in patients with COPD-PH. Furthermore, higher levels of miR-190a-5p were associated with a lower PO₂ and greater severity of COPD-PH. This implies that circulating miR-190a-5p not only serves as a marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of COPD-PH, but can also be used to evaluate the severity and progression of the disease.
