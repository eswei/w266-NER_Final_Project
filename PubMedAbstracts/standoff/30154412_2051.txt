 Arrest-defective protein 1 (ARD1; also known as N-α-acetyltransferase 10 [Naa10p]) was originally found in yeast and is a catalytic subunit of the NatA acetyltransferase, which is responsible for N-terminal α-acetylation ⁷ , ⁸ . ARD1 has both N-terminal α-protein and ε-protein acetyltransferase activities, and promotes the growth of lung cancer cells through the ε-acetylation of β-catenin ⁸ , ⁹ . A previous study revealed that ARD1 overexpression correlated with poor survival of human lung cancer patients ¹⁰ . ARD1 was found to be overexpressed in breast cancer ¹¹ , colorectal cancer ¹² , and hepatocellular cancer ¹³ . Likewise, ARD1 also mediates the growth of colon cancer cells, and high expression of ARD1 in colon cancer is associated with poor prognosis ¹² , ¹⁴ . Depletion of ARD1 sensitizes colon cancer cells to induce apoptosis through RelA/p65-regulated MCL1 expression ¹⁵ . These findings tend to support the model that ARD1 is an oncoprotein that promotes tumor growth. However, ARD1 was also shown to promote DNA damage-mediated apoptosis ⁸ , ¹⁶ . Furthermore, ARD1 was found to inhibit breast and lung cancer cell metastasis ¹⁷ – ¹⁹ . Meanwhile, increased ARD1 expression was reported to associate with better clinical effects in patients with breast and lung cancer. ARD1 overexpression inhibited breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis ¹⁷ – ¹⁹ . These results suggest that ARD1 may function as a tumor suppressor. These conflicting experimental data might result not only from different experimental methods and materials in different laboratories but also might indicate that ARD1 can play different roles in different tumor cell types and even subtypes. After all, ARD1 is highly expressed in primary tumors but has low expression in tumors with lymph node metastases ¹⁷ .
