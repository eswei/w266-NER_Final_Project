 Differences in cytokine/chemokine levels between TAK and GCA To determine cytokine/chemokine profiles suitable to distinguish TAK and GCA, we compared the levels of cytokines/chemokines at diagnosis between the two diseases (Fig. 1). Among the 38 cytokines and chemokines tested, the levels of 7 cytokines and chemokines, IL-1RA, IL-10, GM-CSF, G-CSF, FGF-2, eotaxin, and IP-10, were significantly different between TAK and GCA. The levels of IL-1RA, IL-10, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and FGF-2 were higher in TAK than in GCA. The levels of eotaxin and IP-10 were higher in patients with GCA than those with TAK. No differences were found in the levels of IL-6, IL-12(p40), IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, which have been reported to be associated with TAK ⁹ and/or GCA ¹⁰ . Figure 1 Results of a multiplex cytokines/chemokine bead assay using serum obtained at diagnosis from patients with Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) and sex- and age-matched healthy donors (HD-TAK and HD-GCA). Symbols represent individual patients or donors. Horizontal lines show the median and interquartile range. The Steel-Dwass test was performed for comparisons of multiplex cytokine/chemokine bead assay results in the four groups, i.e., TAK, GCA, HD-TAK, and HD-GCA.
