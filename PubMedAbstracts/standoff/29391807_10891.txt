 NCOA5 was initially identified as a unique coactivator that is independent of AF2 and can modulate ERa-mediated transcription. 24 , 25 NCOA5 is also involved in several human diseases, including Behçet’s disease, 31 type 2 diabetes, 32 and cholesterol metabolism. 32 Recent studies have found that NCOA5 is significantly related to human cancer. Gao et al found that 18-month-old mice with haplo-insufficient NCOA5 can develop hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, NCOA5 is significantly downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma 29 , 33 and is involved in cell cycle regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma. 30 Chen et al showed that the low expression level of NCOA5 is associated with the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and thus could be used to predict poor prognosis. 28 However, in our previous study, NCOA5 was significantly upregulated in luminal breast cancer tissues compared with that in adjacent noncancerous tissues and the high NCOA5 expression is correlated with poor prognosis in luminal breast cancer. 27 In the present study, NOCA5 expression was significantly downregulated in PTC. This finding is consistent with most studies concerning human cancer and indicated that NOCA5 plays different roles in different kinds of human cancer. The exact cellular mechanisms of NOCA5 must be further explored. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to present the significant role of NCOA5 in PTC.
