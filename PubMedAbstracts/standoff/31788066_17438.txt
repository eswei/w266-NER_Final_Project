 TGF-β signaling inhibits tumor growth at the initial stage of cancer development but promotes tumor metastasis via EMT at later stages ( 15 ). Differential expression of TGF-β isoforms has also been observed in different stages of glioma ( 16 ). It has been reported that TGF-β may serve as a potential target for the treatment of glioma ( 14 ). The cross talk between TGF-β and lncRNAs has been extensively reported in different types of malignancy ( 17 – 19 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, studies regarding the interactions between TGF-β and lncRNAs are relatively rare. The present study identified a significant positive correlation between the plasma levels of TGF-β1 and AWPPH in patients with glioma. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that AWPPH may be an upstream activator of TGF-β1 in glioma. AWPPH overexpression upregulated TGF-β1 expression in human glioma cells, while TGF-β1 treatment demonstrated no significant effects on AWPPH expression. Additionally, treatment with the TGF-β inhibitor LY2109761 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion, and attenuated the effects of AWPPH overexpression. These data also suggest that inhibition of endogenous TGF-β may serve as a therapeutic target for glioma.
