 Previous studies have reported that miR-199a-5p, functioning as a cancer suppressor, is downregulated in multiple malignant solid tumors such as hepatocarcinoma [ 7 ], colorectal cancer [ 10 ], breast cancer [ 37 ], ovarian cancer [ 8 ], osteosarcoma [ 9 ], bladder urothelial carcinoma [ 38 ], papillary thyroid carcinoma [ 39 ], and prostate adenocarcinoma [ 40 ]. Accumulating evidence has linked aberrant miR-199a-5p expression to acquired chemoresistance in some cancer types [ 9 , 14 , 15 , 17 ]. For instance, silencing of miR-199a-5p was found to be involved in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer by regulating IKKB expression [ 41 ]. Overexpression of miR-199a-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma was shown to modulate tumor cells sensitivity to doxorubicin by targeting the MET-oncogene [ 7 ]. Abnormally upregulated in CTX-resistant colon carcinoma cells, miR-199a-5p is also reported to affect cancer cell resistance by targeting PHLPP1 [ 42 ]. Although miR-199a-5p may regulate chemoresistance by targeting different genes in different cancer types, the mechanisms could be generally summarized as cell cycle arrest, proliferation decrease, invasion prevention, and apoptosis inhibition [ 7 , 8 , 35 , 41 â€“ 43 ]. However, several recent research studies indicated that miR-199a-5p is implicated in chemoresistance of cancer cells via inhibition of autophagic pathways [ 9 , 14 ]. In this regard, autophagy is activated as a protective mechanism to mediate the acquired resistance phenotype of some cancer cells during chemotherapy. Thus, the inhibition of autophagy can resensitize previously resistant cancer cells and increase therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy. However, data for miR-199a-5p expression and function, especially the correlation between miR-199a-5p and autophagy, in leukemia cells are very limited.
