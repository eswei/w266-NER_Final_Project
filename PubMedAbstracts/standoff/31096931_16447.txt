 Our results showed that 25(OH)D concentrations were lower in the GDM group than in the control group. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with insulin resistance and GDM [ 8 ]. The VDR gene has a role in the metabolic pathway of insulin [ 9 ]. VDR gene variations have beenshown to be correlated in the development, progression, and complications of T2DM [ 13 – 15 ]. The present study showed that VDR gene FokI SNPs were independently associated with an increased risk of GDM in Turkish women (β = 1.63, 95% CI: [1. 2-4.2], p = 0.012). Our study suggested that VDR gene FokI SNPs might be associated with having GDM. We found that the frequency of VDR gene ApaI, TaqI, and BsmI did not differ between women with and without GDM. VDR gene ApaI, TaqI, and BsmI SNPs were not associated with GDM. The VDR gene FokI SNP showed significant differences between women with and without GDM. VDR gene FokI (variant or heterozygotes) compared to wild-type (CC) SNP revealed a significant association. VDR gene FokI rs2228570 TT (TT vs. CC, OR = 3.95, 95% CI: [1.56–9.96], p = 0.002) and CT heterozygotes (CT vs. CC, OR = 1.84, 95% CI: [1.05–3.239, p = 0.031) were associated with having GDM, compared with the controls. VDR gene FokI SNPs might contribute to developing GDM in the Turkish population.
