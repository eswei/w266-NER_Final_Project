 As we all known that the regular growth and development of placenta is one of the most important step in a healthy pregnancy. However, the occurrence of GDM always along with the maldevelopment of placenta [ 6 ]. HG, as a characteristic of GDM, leads to the impaired function of trophoblast cells, thereby suppressing the normal development of placenta [ 33 ]. In the current study, the proliferation of trophoblast cell HTR-8/SVneo and BeWo was obviously inhibited by the HG treatment, which is consistent with the previous reports [ 33 ]. Additionally, HG treatment was also found to result in an inhibition in the expression of miR-132 in the trophoblast cells. Furthermore, the gain-of-function analysis indicated that the suppressed trophoblast cell proliferation induced by HG could be rescued by the overexpression of miR-132. miR-132 has been previously reported to regulate cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer [ 34 ] and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [ 35 ]. Thus, we considered that miR-132 might exert a protective role against GDM by enhancing the trophoblast cell proliferation. Zhang et al. has reported that miR-132 could facilitate cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) [ 34 ]. PETN is a major upstream inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling, and has been identified as a critical molecule in GDM [ 36 ]. Li et al. found that plasma PTEN levels was associated with insulin resistance of GDM [ 37 ]. In addition, the increased expression of PTEN mediates the regulatory effects of miR-21 [ 38 ] and miR-144 [ 39 ] on the biological function of trophoblastic cells. Thus, we suspected that protective action of miR-132 in GDM might also achieved through targeting PTEN. The precise mechanisms underlying the role of miR-132 in GDM need to be investigated in future studies.
