 Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-protein coding transcripts (more than 200 nt) which have been demonstrated widely as vital regulators in gene expression, cellular function and disease processes ( Boon et al., 2016 ). Mounting evidence have demonstrated that lncRNAs play an important role in the progression of DN ( Alvarez & Distefano, 2013 ). For example, lncRNA MALAT1 expression is increased in experimental DN and MALAT1 inhibition attenuates high glucose (HG)-induced podocyte injury by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling ( Gutschner, Hämmerle & Diederichs, 2013 ; Hu et al., 2017 ). The roles of other lncRNAs (e.g., Tug1, Erbb4-IR, Gm4419, TCF7, etc.) in DN have also been identified ( Liu & Sun, 2019 ; Long et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 2018 ; Yi et al., 2017 ). Our previous study showed that lncRNA Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) is downregulated in bladder cancer and regulates cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling and autophagy ( Ying et al., 2013 ). Given the important role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the progression of DN, we speculated that MEG3 might be associated with DN. Additionally, MEG3 was recently reported to be involved in DM-related microvascular dysfunction ( Qiu et al., 2016 ). Genome imprinting study showed that MEG3 gene region on chromosome 14q32.2 is associated with the susceptibility of type one diabetes ( Wallace et al., 2010 ). Therefore, the present study investigated the role of MEG3 in podocyte injury and DN and our data showed that MEG3 attenuated HG-induced podocyte injury by repressing Wnt/β-catenin activity.
