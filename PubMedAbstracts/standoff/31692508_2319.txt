 Recent studies have highlighted that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to cancer progression. Long non-coding RNAs are endogenous cellular RNAs which are more than 200 nucleotides in length. LncRNAs may regulate the cell processes by mediating transcription or post-transcription. It was reported that lncRNAs could interact with DNA, RNA, and protein to play the regulatory roles. Their dysregulation may lead to many diseases including cancers. For example, lncRNA p10247 overexpression is correlated with metastasis in breast cancer. 3 Downregulated lncRNA-HOTAIR suppressed colorectal cancer proliferation, invasion, and migration. 4 LncRNA MIR4435-2HG promoted lung cancer progression. 5 LINC00844 regulates cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer. 6 LncRNA TBILA may promote the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition of non-small cell lung cancer. 7 Besides the above-mentioned cancer types, lncRNAs also play roles in HCC. LncRNA FLVCR-AS1, 8 HNF1A-AS1, 9 HOXA11-AS, 10 and lncRNA OGFRP1 11 were upregulated, while XLOC006926, 12 CASC2, 13 and lncRNA NKILA 14 were downregulated in HCC. However, there are still many lncRNAs involved in HCC tumorigenesis and progression that need to be explored.
