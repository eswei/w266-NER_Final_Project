 Important roles for eNOS uncoupling and BH4 deficiency in AAA formation have been recently reported in hph-1 mice, which have a moderate systemic BH4 deficiency because of a global reduction in Gch1 expression. Hph-1 mice treated with Ang II at 0.7 mg/kg per day, show an increased eNOS uncoupling and AAA formation. ⁵ However, the hph-1 mouse has a global BH4 deficiency, affecting all cells and tissues, so is not possible to dissect out how BH4 deficiency mediates the increase in vascular pathology. Notably, in the present studies, Ang II infusion even at a subpressor dose (0.4 mg/kg per day) greatly increased the incidence of AAA in Gch1ᶠˡ/ᶠˡTie2cre mice, associated with eNOS uncoupling and increased aortic eNOS-derived H₂O₂ generation. Vascular H₂O₂ has been previously implicated in the pathology of AAA in various mouse models of AAA, including the Ang II, elastase, and CaCl₂ model. ¹⁶ , ³² , ³³ Indeed, H₂O₂ has been reported to promote MMP-3 (matrix metalloproteinase-3), MMP-9, and MMP-12 expression, which are implicated in extracellular matrix degradation that is important in the pathogenesis of AAA. ³⁴ Administration of polyethylene glycol catalase or overexpression of catalase in VSMC has been reported to reduce the formation of AAA by enhancing VSMC survival and decreasing MMP activity. ³³ We have previously shown that increased endothelial cell superoxide by Nox-2 overexpression is sufficient to predispose mice to AAA formation. ²² Taken together, these data strongly indicate that increased endothelial cell H₂O₂ production because of eNOS uncoupling is sufficient to increase AAA formation.
