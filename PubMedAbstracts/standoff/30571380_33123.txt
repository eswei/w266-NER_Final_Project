 Medical Therapy and Biomarkers Fabry patients who qualify for and receive ERT (n=37, 54%) had greater plasma levels of TNF, TNFR1, TNFR2, MMP‐2, and Lyso‐Gb₃ (P=0.025, P=0.003, P<0.001, P<0.001, and P=0.001, respectively) (Figure 9). Among patients who were prescribed either an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (n=50, 74%), plasma MMP‐2 and MMP‐8 were elevated (P=0.027 and 0.015, respectively). Patients prescribed a statin (n=39, 57%) had significantly increased plasma levels of BNP, MR‐proANP, galectin‐1, and galectin‐3 (P=0.007, 0.001, 0.023, and 0.001, respectively), whereas patients prescribed aspirin (n=46, 68%) had significantly elevated plasma levels of BNP, MR‐proANP, and MMP‐8 (P=0.008, P=0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). Figure 9 Plasma levels of biomarkers in FD patients (n=68), in cohorts of those not receiving ERT (n=31) and those who qualify for and are receiving ERT (n=37). TNF, TNFR1, TNFR2, MMP‐2, and Lyso‐Gb₃ are elevated in FD patients undergoing ERT relative to those not receiving ERT. ERT indicates enzyme replacement therapy; FD, Fabry disease; Lyso‐Gb₃, lysoglobotriaosylceramide; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor. **P<0.01; ***P<0.001.
