 It was reported that the annual growth rate of atheromas in the carotid arteries plateaus around the G3 stage in CKD patients [ 31 ]. Furthermore, the risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease increases after CKD progresses to stage G3-G4. After the progression of CKD to stage G4-5, non-atherosclerotic disease becomes the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 32 ]. In this study, the relative serum HMW-ADPN level was found to be positively correlated with the serum HDL-C level, but negatively correlated with the serum levels of LDL-C and non-HDL-C. In addition, the patients with advanced calcification of the abdominal aorta displayed lower absolute and relative serum HMW-ADPN levels. Our results suggest that treating dyslipidemia might ameliorate arterial calcification by increasing the serum HMW-ADPN level in renal allograft recipients because the patientsâ€™ renal function improved from CKD stage G5D to stage G2-G3aT after the renal transplants. Otherwise, a recent report by Chen et al. found that repeated coronary artery calcification (CAC) imaging in 35 patients with end-stage renal disease showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. They also found that in vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by human vascular smooth muscle cells was significantly impaired by statins [ 33 ]. Hence, novel therapies to target lipids may be needed in patients with kidney disease in future.
