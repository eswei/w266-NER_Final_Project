 Small vessel vasculitis is the underlying pulmonary lesion in most cases of pulmonary renal syndrome. Previous studies demonstrated that in patients with ANCA-negative rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, pulmonary findings occurred much less commonly than those with ANCA positive vasculitis.[ ⁹ , ¹⁰ ] Eisenberger et al[ ⁸ ] reported pulmonary involvement in 3 out of 20 patients with ANCA negative pauci immune renal vasculitis of which 2 had cavitary nodules. Farah et al[ ¹¹ ] reported one case of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) associated with pauci-immune renal vasculitis that terminated in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). However, association of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with ANCA negative glomerulonephritis is rare. The pathogenesis of this association is not clear, neutrophil infiltration was found in glomerular lesions in one study.[ ¹² ] Wang et al[ ¹⁴ ] found higher levels of serum neutrophil-gelatinase-associated lipocalin and lactoferrin in patients with ANCA-negative pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis than in patients with ANCA-positive disease. The clinical presentation of pulmonary renal syndrome in ANCA negative vasculitis is non-specific and a high degree of clinical suspicion is essential for a prompt diagnosis. Patients present with cough and dyspnea which may or may not be accompanied by hemoptysis. Hemoptysis may be absent in up to 30% to 35% of patients with DAH and one half of these patients may require mechanical ventilation.[ ⁴ ] Renal involvement presents with hematuria, proteinuria, sometimes leading to end stage renal failure.
