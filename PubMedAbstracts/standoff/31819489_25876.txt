 Emerging evidence reveals that lincRNAs can act as a ceRNA to sponge miRNAs and then regulate the expression of the targets of miRNA. In this study, LINC00667 was predicted and confirmed to be a ceRNA of miR-143-3p. LINC00667 has been reported to be associated with survival of small hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 32 but its role in NSCLC remains unclear. Database analysis and RT-qPCR detection results demonstrated that LINC00667 was highly expressed in cancer tissues and NSCLC cell lines. The result of dualâ€‘luciferase reporter assay further validated the association between LINC00667 and miR-143-3p. Moreover, we found that the expression of LINC00667 and miR-143-3p was antagonistic to each other in NSCLC cell lines. RIP analysis further confirmed the association between the two ncRNAs. The expression of RRM2 was regulated by both LINC00667 and miR-143-3p, and all three molecules synergistically control the growth of NSCLC cell lines. In vivo experiments also discovered that LINC00667 knockdown or miR-143-3p overexpression could decrease the expression of RRM2 and proliferation-related genes, therefore inhibiting the growth of tumor. Recently Zhou et al reported that LINC00667 was one of seven lincRNAs involved in the progression of NSCLS, which is consistent with our current findings. 33
