 Previous studies have demonstrated that miR-543 may act as a tumor-suppressor gene or oncogene ( 43 , 44 ). Earlier research found that miR-543 exhibits low expression in glioma, and induced tumor cell apoptosis, inhibited growth, the cell cycle, migration and the invasion of cancer cells ( 45 ). In previous research, it was demonstrated that miR-543 suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle and induced apoptosis by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and the phosphorylation of downstream factors including RSK2 and MSK1 was impeded ( 15 ). However, the present study did not further verify whether miR-543 affects OSCC through the ERK2/MAPK signaling pathway, which will be a direction for subsequent research. In addition, miR-543 exhibited a similar decrease in colorectal cancer and inhibited the growth, invasion and metastasis of colon cancer by targeting kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, metastasis-associated 1 and high mobility group AT-hook 2 genes ( 46 ). However, additional studies have revealed that miR-543 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer ( 16 ). In addition, miR-543 was upregulated in lung cancer, and promoted the cell proliferation and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog protein ( 12 ). In gastric cancer and osteosarcoma, miR-543 was observed to be overexpressed and to serve as an oncogene to promote cancer cell proliferation and glycolysis ( 13 , 47 ). Furthermore, miR-543 was also found to be highly expressed in prostate cancer and was confirmed to directly target receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 to promote cell proliferation and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which promoted cell invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo ( 48 ).
