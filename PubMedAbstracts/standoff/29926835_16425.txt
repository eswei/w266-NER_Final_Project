 CRMP-2 mutant constructs and transfection of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Ycells Human CRMP-2 with N-terminal FLAG tag cloned into pRK5 mammalian expression vector was obtained from Dr. Lisa Ooms (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia). Site directed mutagenesis was performed (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to produce the following CRMP-2 mutants: T509A, T514A, S518A, S522A, and T555A using the following primers; T509A forward 5′-gtg tga agt gtc tgt ggc gcc caa gac agt cac-3′, T509A reverse 5′-gtg act gtc ttg ggc gcc aca gac act tca cac-3′, T514A forward, 5′-gcc caa gac agt cgc tcc agc ctc ctc-3′, T514A reverse 5′-gag gag gct gga gcg act gtc ttg ggc-3′, S518A forward 5’-cac tcc agc ctc cgc ggc caa gac gtc-3’, S518A reverse 5′-gac gtc ttg gcc gcg gag gct gga gtg-3′, S522A forward 5′-ctc ggc caa gac ggc tcc tgc caa gca-3′, S522A reverse 5′-tgc ttg gca gga gcc gtc ttg gcc gag-3′, T555A forward 5′-ccc gcc gca ccg ccc agc gta tc-3′, T555A reverse 5′-gat acg ctg ggc ggt gcg gcg gg-3′. The CRMP-2 mutant constructs with FLAG tag were then subcloned into pCMV-Tag5 mammalian expression vector (Agilent Technologies) containing a C-terminal Myc tag and Kanamycin resistance. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 6-well plates in DMEM/F12 medium until they were 80% confluent. On the day prior to transfection, medium was replaced with OPTI-MEM antibiotic and serum free media (Invitrogen) for 24 hours. The cells in each well were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 2 μg/well of pCMV-Tag5, pCMV-Tag5-CRMP2-T555A, pCMV-Tag5-CRMP2-T514A, pCMV-Tag5-CRMP2-T509A, pCMV-Tag5-CRMP2-S518A or pCMV-Tag5-CRMP2-S522A. Cells were then treated with Aβ peptides as described earlier. Cells were lysed and proteins were collected for immunoprecipitation and western immunoblotting.
