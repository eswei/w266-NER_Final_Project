 In this study, a Mann-Whitney U test showed that the median progesterone level was significantly increased in the patient group with sexual dysfunction when compared with the patient group without sexual dysfunction. An independent sample t-test showed that the mean creatinine levels were significantly increased in the non-sexual dysfunction group compared with the sexual dysfunction group, but in both study groups, the progesterone and creatinine levels were in the normal range. These findings support that measurement of serum progesterone and creatinine might not be promising indicators of sexual dysfunction. An independent sample t-test showed that the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin level were significantly increased in patients with schizophrenia and without sexual dysfunction compared with patients with sexual dysfunction, but logistic regression analysis did not support a relationship between these two factors. Red blood cells contain a large amount of hemoglobin, and hemoglobin carries oxygen (Oâ‚‚), which means that a high hemoglobin level might be a protective factor for sexual dysfunction. Also, following univariate analysis, testosterone levels were found to be significantly increased in patients without sexual dysfunction compared with patients with sexual dysfunction. However, logistic regression analysis did not indicate that a high testosterone level was a protective factor against sexual dysfunction. Therefore, further studies are required that include larger study sizes to determine the role of progesterone, creatinine, hemoglobin, and testosterone levels in patients with schizophrenia and sexual dysfunction.
