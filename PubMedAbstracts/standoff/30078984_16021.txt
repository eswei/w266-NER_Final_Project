 The current study identified four novel gene mutations, among which the mutations in CHMP4B and FOXE3 were not common in congenital cataracts. To date, only two mutations in the CHMP4B gene have been reported to cause congenital cataracts: the p.D129V mutation in an American Caucasian family and the p.E161K mutation in a Japanese family [ 5 ]. The patient carrying the p.D129V mutation exhibited posterior subcapsular opacity, similar to the phenotype of the patient who carried the p.H57R mutation in the CHMP4B gene in the present study. The p.H57R mutation and the other two reported mutations were all located in the SNF7 domain of the CHMP4B gene. This domain is involved in endosome- and lysosome-associated protein sorting and trafficking [ 6 ]. It has been suggested that gain-of-function defects in an endosome-sorting complex (ESCRT-III) subunit trigger loss of lens transparency [ 5 ]. Another novel mutation detected in the present study was the FOXE3 c.179_181del, p.60_61del mutation, located in the forkhead domain of the FOXE3 gene. Apart from causing congenital cataracts, mutations in the FOXE3 gene may also lead to anterior segment dysgenesis, including posterior embryotoxon, microphthalmia, and Peterâ€™s anomaly [ 7 - 9 ]. However, in the present study, anterior segment dysgenesis was not observed in patient WCC9, who carried the FOXE3 p.60_61del mutation. Most mutations examined in previous studies were missense and small insertions. Therefore, we speculate that the FOXE3 p.60_61del mutation had little effect on the function of the protein, other than missense or frameshift mutations. Dominique et al. found a mutation in the FOXE3 gene in 4% of all French patients with congenital cataracts [ 10 ]. In the present study, the frequency of mutations in the FOXE3 gene was approximately 5%. Due to restricted expression of Foxe3 in the lens epithelia of developing and adult mice, researchers found that chamber angle defects associated with mutations in mouse Foxe3 might result from changes in Pitx3, a gene in the same regulatory pathway as Foxe3 [ 7 ]. In the present study, patient WCC16 carrying the novel c.489dupC, p.V164fs mutation in the MIP gene had nuclear cataracts. The mutation was in the transmembrane domain H5 of the MIP gene. In Chinese patients with congenital cataracts, a missense mutation in the MIP gene leads to progressive cortical punctate cataracts [ 11 , 12 ], a nonsense mutation in the MIP gene leads to Y sutural associated with cortical punctate cataracts [ 13 ], and a splice mutation in the MIP gene results in nuclear cataracts [ 14 ], suggesting strong genetic heterogeneity of the MIP gene. The fourth novel mutation in the present study was the p.P492L mutation in the HSF4 gene, which caused a zonular cataract in patient WCC18. This mutation was located in the COOH-terminal intracellular domain of the protein. The phenotype of the cohort patients was similar to that of patients reported by Bu et al. [ 15 ], showing a perinuclear shape with a transparent embryonic nucleus.
