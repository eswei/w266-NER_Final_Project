 The pathogenesis of ED in DM is not fully elucidated due to the multifactorial and complicated nature of DM. The mechanisms that prevail in the pathogenesis of T1DM ED and T2DM ED may differ due to the different characteristics of T1DM and T2DM, such as insulin resistance and body mass index status. 4 It has been demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress play crucial roles for the development of T2DM ED. 4 5 6 7 8 9 Endothelial dysfunction is often characterized by a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability resulting from decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity or expression, or increased NO scavenging. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduce the availability of NO through direct or indirect mechanisms, such as a reaction with NO to form the toxic nitrating agent peroxynitrite, promoting eNOS uncoupling, and apoptosis. 10 11 12 A recent study shows that eNOS uncoupling and increased oxidative stress via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation occur prior to carotid artery at the early stage of T2DM in the penis, emphasizing the role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of T2DM ED. 13 Therefore, new treatment strategies for T2DM ED targeting endothelial function preservation are necessary.
