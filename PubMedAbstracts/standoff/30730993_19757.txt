 Serum cardiac troponin is a specific and sensitive biomarker of cardiac injury that can detect even minor myocardial injury [ 19 ]. Cardiac troponin can neither cross the placenta, due to its molecular size, nor can it be produced in the placenta [ 20 , 21 ]. Therefore, the elevated cTnI after delivery could indicate myocardial injury during delivery. In the present study, PIH, placental abnormality, and decreased hemoglobin after delivery were the factors associated with elevated cTnI levels. PIH is a hypertensive disorder during pregnancy closely linked to preeclampsia. In pregnant women with preeclampsia, placental hypoperfusion caused by abnormalities in the development of the placental vasculature induces the release of antiangiogenic factors, which impair vascular endothelial function in the placental and maternal circulation [ 22 – 24 ]. Moreover, increased sensitivity to angiotensin II has been reported in preeclampsia [ 22 , 23 ]. These changes could lead to myocardial injury due to microcirculatory disorders in addition to hypertension’s effects. Indeed, previous articles reported elevated cTnI levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease during postpartum follow-up in pregnant woman with PIH [ 20 , 25 ]. Additionally, the risk factors for placental abruption are advanced age, multiple gestation, and PIH, which are also risk factors for PPCM [ 26 – 29 ]. Additionally, placenta previa is related to increased bleeding during delivery and the subsequent anemia. In addition to bleeding, which increases the vascular resistance, increased blood pressure during pregnancy might lead to temporal hypoperfusion and subsequent myocardial injury [ 30 , 31 ]. These factors are closely linked and affect each other. Thus, subclinical myocardial injury might occur during the peripartum period if PIH, placental abnormality, and anemia after delivery are present.
