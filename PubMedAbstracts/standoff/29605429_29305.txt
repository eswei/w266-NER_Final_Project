 Alterations in sodium channel function in SIDS are qualitatively similar to those reported in infants with life-threatening respiratory events. 9 , 12 , 14 Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function SCN4A variants can cause severe respiratory presentations in infancy and some of these cases have had a fatal outcome. 8 , 9 , 14 In our study, only the SCN4A variants present in white SIDS cases caused significant alterations in channel function compared with wild type. By contrast, the variants we discovered in control adults did not alter channel function. The Arg1463Ser and Ser682Trp variants caused impaired fast inactivation that resulted in a predominantly gain-of-function effect in the NaV1.4 sodium channel. Similar gain-of-function alterations in channel function are the hallmark of SCN4A variants in patients with myotonia, including in infants with severe respiratory complications. ²⁵ The pathogenic role of Arg1463Ser is also supported by its presence in a patient under our care (EM, MGH) with generalised myotonia. The heterozygous loss-of-function variants we discovered in the SIDS cohort caused either substantial enhancement of fast inactivation (Val1442Met) or reduced current density (Glu1520Lys). Compound heterozygous or homozygous loss-of-function NaV1.4 variants (including the previously reported Val1442Met variant) cause myasthenic syndrome and congenital myopathy. 12 , 14 Some of these patients need respiratory support. 12 , 14 These observations support the notion that disrupted sodium channel function in the respiratory muscles can contribute to life-threatening events.
