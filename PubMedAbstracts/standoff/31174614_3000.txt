 Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic protein that participates in many cellular activities and plays an essential role in regulating the inflammatory response, energy metabolism, and apoptosis. MIF has been shown to be beneficial in promoting survival of cardiomyocytes during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) by inhibiting apoptosis, reducing ROS production and regulating glucose metabolism [ 5 – 7 ]. Previously, we have shown upregulation of MIF by hypoxia in the acute phase of stroke [ 8 , 9 ] and demonstrated the protective role of MIF in suppressing oxidative stress-induced caspase-3 activation [ 10 ]. MIF has also been identified as a PARP-1 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1)-dependent AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor)-associated nuclease (PAAN), and disruption of MIF’s nuclease activity inhibited cell death induced by glutamate excitotoxicity and focal stroke [ 11 ]. In AD pathogenesis, neuronal death through apoptotic pathways is observed, and there is evidence suggesting that oxidative stress originating from dysregulation of mitochondria functions serves as a cause of apoptosis [ 12 ]. Therefore, MIF may be essential for neuronal survival during AD pathogenesis. In contrast, MIF could also play a deleterious role when overexpressed by immune cells, resulting in excessive inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases in the systems outside of the CNS [ 13 ]. Whether MIF plays a role in initiating and/or maintaining the inflammatory status in the CNS remains unknown. In AD patients, Aβ deposits induce chronic neuroinflammation which features in the activation of resident microglia and infiltration of peripheral macrophages [ 14 ]. However, the current understanding of the expression regulation of MIF and its role in AD is limited. This study aimed to investigate how MIF would participate in these seemly paradoxical roles during AD pathogenesis.
