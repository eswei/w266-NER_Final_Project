 On the other hand, high levels of mRNA and IFN-γ have been found in different samples (gingival tissue, serum, saliva, and GCF) of CP patients when compared to HS. ¹⁴ ⁻ ¹⁹ This study found high levels of IFN-γ in the gingival tissues of CP patients when compared to HS, corroborating these studies. We must highlight that only Górska, et al. ¹⁷ (2003) and Johnson, et al. ¹⁸ (2005) have detected elevated IFN-γ levels in gingival tissue samples from CP patients. These authors reported the IFN-γ levels in pg/mL; in this study we decided to report IFN-γ in pg/mg of gingival tissues by ELISA. Similarly, IFN-γ concentrations were found to be significantly higher in CP patients than in HS. Given this context, it has been described that high IFN-γ levels in the infected periodontium are associated with the progression of lesions and the severity of inflammatory diseases. ²¹ In addition, the antigen stimuli and pathways lead to chronic elevation of IFN-γ and maintain the activation of resident phagocytes in the periodontium through the secretion of metalloproteinases (MMP) and other molecules, which leads to increased bone destruction. ¹⁶ In this sense, we found a significant correlation between high IFN-γ levels in gingival tissue and clinical parameters (PD and CAL) in the CP group, confirming that elevated IFN-γ levels in CP patients are related with bone destruction in the periodontium.
