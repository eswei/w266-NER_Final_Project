 Based on previous reports suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and SDHB mutations promote EMT [ 4 , 37 ], we hypothesized that altered enzyme function of SDH may be a determining factor and possibly an integral part of EMT in human tumors, which could be linked to an overarching shift in mitochondrial function and dynamics. Thorough analyses in breast cancer patient cohorts revealed a relatively consistent inverse association between EMT and reduced expression of the SDHC subunit. Upon molecular and histological classification of the breast cancer cohorts, we found that the relationship between SDHC and EMT was stronger in the basal-like subgroup compared to the non-basal-like subgroup. Interestingly, when looking at overall survival, low SDHC level was associated with a worse outcome in basal-like breast carcinoma. This finding can imply that suppressed activity of SDH-linked mitochondrial pathways is associated with a worse prognosis in basal-like breast carcinomas. As mitochondrial function is challenging to assess in frozen and paraffin-embedded samples, there is an urgent need for indicative markers reflecting mitochondrial abnormalities. Our results suggest that SDHC expression could serve as a potential prognostic marker to enable further discrimination in the basal-like breast carcinoma subgroup. Furthermore, upon histological classification of the n = 204 breast cancer cohort, we found the inverse association between SDHC and EMT to be more pronounced in the ductal subgroup, compared to the lobular, but we did not see an impact on the overall survival.
