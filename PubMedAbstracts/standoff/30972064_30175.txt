 VPA has been used in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 mM ( 35 – 37 ). To study the modulation of MICA expression and release from tumor cells, Armeanu et al. used 1 mM VPA for human hepatoma cells. Their results showed a differential induction of NKG2D ligands by VPA on malignant and non-malignant cells ( 34 ). Yamanegi et al. also used VPA at 0.5- and 1-mM concentration for human osteosarcoma cells revealing increase in the cell-surface but not soluble form of MICA/B ( 38 ). In contrast, our study revealed only minor changes in the shedding of MICA from Panc89 cells and no changes at all in PC-3 cells after treatment with 1 mM VPA. In fact, NKG2D ligand (MICA/B and ULBP-2) gene expression was remarkably induced with 2.5 mM VPA both on malignant (pancreatic carcinoma cells Panc89 and prostate carcinoma cells PC-3) and non-malignant cells (PBMC and γδ T cells). The use of 2.5 mM VPA concentration to induce MICA protein expression is consistent with a previous study performed with Hodgkin lymphoma cells ( 39 ). The ULBP-1 expression is known to be associated with proteasome regulation ( 40 ). Remarkably, VPA failed to induce ULBP-1 expression on Panc89 and PC-3 cells. Nevertheless, the treatment of melanoma cells with 1 mM VPA has been shown to induce only MICA, MICB and ULBP-2, mediated by the ERK pathway ( 41 ), which is also consistent with our results using Panc89 and PC-3 tumor cells. The role of specific signaling pathways like ERK1/2 and AKT in cellular responses of Panc89 and PC-3 to VPA treatment remains to be investigated.
