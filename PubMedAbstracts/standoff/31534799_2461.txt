 Since the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), many novel loci associated with common human diseases have been identified [ 7 ], including CKD [ 3 , 8 – 10 ]. A genetic polymorphism in shroom family member 3 (SHROOM3) has been identified as a CKD susceptibility locus through GWAS. SHROOM3 is a regulator of epithelial cellular arrangement and planar remodeling [ 11 ], which contributes to glomerular filtration barrier integrity [ 12 ]. Many studies have suggested that SHROOM3 plays an important role in mammalian kidney development and human kidney disease through estimated GFR (eGFR). One of these CKD-associated SHROOM3 variants, rs17319721, has been shown to impact cis-expression and renal allograft fibrosis [ 13 ]. Genetic polymorphisms in solute carrier family 7-member 9 (SLC7A9) gene, an amino acid transporter in renal proximal tubule cells, cause cystinuria [ 14 ], showing an association with GFR [ 3 , 15 ], and have been identified as a risk factor for CKD patients of European ancestry [ 8 ]. Variants of cystatin C (CST3) have been also shown to impact altered eGFR and kidney disease [ 16 ]. Polymorphisms in myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) gene on chromosome 22 have been shown to be associated with a risk for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HIV-associated nephropathy CKD with admixed nondiabetic kidney disease, hypertension-associated ESRD, and nondiabetic etiologies of ESRD [ 17 – 20 ]. The MYH9 risk polymorphisms are common among African Americans, contributing approximately 40–45% of all ESRD and 70% of nondiabetic ESRD [ 21 ].
