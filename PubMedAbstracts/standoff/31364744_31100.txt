 A recently published study reported that Linc00961 encoded a novel polypeptide termed SPAAR, which is involved in mTOR complex 1 activation and muscle regeneration ( 14 , 24 ). Additionally, the expression profile and potential function of Linc00961 in genesis and progression of human cancers was preliminarily established; Linc00961 was shown to suppress the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells in vitro, and metastasis in vivo ( 25 ). Furthermore, Linc00961 was also reported to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by upregulating the levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and suppressing the expression of Bax protein in NSCLC ( 17 ). Furthermore, Linc00961 was also downregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma and demonstrated to be a capable diagnostic biomarker ( 26 ). In glioma, Linc00961 was revealed to be downregulated in tissues and cell lines, and its expression was inversely associated with pathological features, poor overall survival and unfavorable prognosis ( 16 ), indicating that Linc00961 functions as a tumor suppressor in glioma. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it was revealed that Linc00961 suppressed RCC progression by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling pathway ( 27 ). Consistent with these previous studies, the present study also demonstrated that Linc00961 functioned as a tumor suppressor gene in the carcinogenesis and development of SM. Linc00961 was demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation, and suppress the tumor growth of SM in vitro and in vivo. It also induced inhibitory effects on the migration and invasion of SM cells; however, the underlying mechanism of Linc00961's suppressive role in SM development is yet to be fully determined.
