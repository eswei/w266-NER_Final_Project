 Genetic factors have an important role in XFS pathogenesis. Our previous data have suggested that three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e.,rs1048661, rs3825942, and rs2165241, of the lysyl oxidase-like 1 gene (LOXL1) were significantly associated with XFS and XFG [ 5 ]. Moreover, Yao et al. have discovered that rs4886467, rs4558370, rs4461027, rs4886761, and rs16958477 SNPs located in the LOXL1 gene promoter region are risk factors for XFS [ 6 ]. In addition, many other SNPs, such as rs429358 and rs7412 located on apolipoprotein E (APOE) [ 7 ], rs2107856 and rs2141388 of contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) [ 8 ], rs41435250 and rs893818 of LOXL1 [ 9 ], rs16958445 of TBC1 domain family member 21 (TBC1D21) [ 10 ], rs7137828 of autosomal-dominant ataxin 2 (ATXN2), rs35934224 of thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2), rs11732100 of actin filament-associated protein 1 (AFAP1), rs2472493 of ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), rs9897123 of growth arrest-specific 7 (GAS7) [ 11 ], rs4926244 of calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A (CACNA1A) [ 12 ], and rs2279590 of clusterin (CLU) [ 13 ], have been associated with XFS/XFG. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to investigate whether these SNPs also affect XFS/XFG.
