 CENPE expression might be induced under a stressful environment in cancer cells. For example, in triple-negative breast cancer cells, CENPE expression was upregulated after Docetaxel treatment [ 13 ]. In castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, the reprogramming of the binding of lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1), which is a histone-modifying enzyme responsible for demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), results in an increase of AR binding at the CENPE promoter and subsequently enhanced CENPE transcription [ 12 ]. These results suggest that epigenetic regulation might be a mechanism of CENPE dysregulation in cancer cells. In fact, epigenetic regulations, such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and up-regulation/down-regulation of genes by non-codling RNAs, have been characterized as important epigenetic regulations related to dysregulated tumor suppressors and other growth regulating genes during the progression of EA [ 23 , 24 ]. In this study, by checking the methylation status of 18 CpG sites in CENPE DNA in EA, we found that three CpG sites with hypomethylated in EA, among which two sites (cg27443373 and cg24651824) showed moderately negative correlation with CENPE expression. Besides, the high methylation group was associated with better OS. In addition, we found that although heterozygous loss (-1) was frequent in EA (50/88, 56.8%), it was not necessarily associated with decreased CENPE expression. The significantly lower level of the average methylation of cg27443373 and cg24651824 in this group provides a plausible explanation of this phenomenon. Based on these findings, we infer that hypomethylation of certain CpG sites in CENPE DNA might be an important epigenetic mechanism of upregulated CENPE in EA.
