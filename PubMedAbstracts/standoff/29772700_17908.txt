 Lipoxygenases are a group of closely related dioxygenases that are classified as 5-, 12-, and 12/15-lipoxygenases according to the site of oxygen insertion within arachidonic acid, which is also a target for other enzymatic pathways, including cyclooxygenase (COX2), and cytochrome P450 [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]. Alox12/15 modulates the inflammatory response and is involved in atherosclerosis [ 42 ]. Overexpression of Alox12/15 in mice promotes monocyte–endothelial cell interactions, leading to atherosclerotic formation [ 43 , 44 ]. In the heart, cardiac Alox12/15 has been reported to stimulate cardiac cell growth [ 45 ] and is involved in cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy [ 37 ]. A recent study further showed that cardiac fibrosis was increased in Alox12/15 transgenic mice and was associated with the infiltration of macrophages, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis in heart failure [ 36 ]. TGFβ has been known to serve as a key mediator of fibrosis in various organs [ 46 ]. TIMP-1 promotes tissue fibrosis by inhibiting extracellular matrix degradation and has been used as a marker of fibrosis [ 47 ]. In the present study, our findings demonstrated Alox12/15 as the most upregulated factor in FC-iPSC-CMs carrying IVS4+919 G>A mutation. Meanwhile, these FC-iPSC-CMs chronologically exhibited several FC-specific features, downregulation of GLA, upregulation of TGFβ, TIMP-1, collagen-1 and Alox12/15, after a 40 to 60-day cardiac induction. The expression pattern of Alox12/15 was highly correlated with severe cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and several fibrosis-associated factors TGFβ, TIMP-1, and collagen-1 are upregulated in the late phase of cardiac induction. These data suggested that Alox12/15 may play a role in the pathogenesis and/or disease progression of FC with IVS4+919 G>A mutation.
