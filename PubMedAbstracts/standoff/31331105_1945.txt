 1. Introduction The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II heterodimeric molecules, composed by the alpha and beta chains, are encoded by many different alleles, which generate the high polymorphism characteristic of this locus. The genes encoding DR and DQ isotypes are the main risk factors associated with several autoimmune diseases. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) are autoimmune disorders, affecting between 0.5% and 1% of the general population. Very frequently, these two diseases co-occur in families, and approximately 4–9% of patients with T1D also have CD, while patients with CD are at increased risk of developing T1D [ 1 ]. CD and T1D share immunopathogenic mechanisms, although the autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies are directed against different autoantigens, such as insulin, GADA65, and IA-2 in T1D [ 2 ] and tissue transglutaminase in CD [ 3 ]. The HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 genes display a major component of familial clustering in both T1D and CD. Subjects at high risk to develop T1D carry either DQ2.5 haplotype, encoded by DQA1*05:01 and DQB1*02:01 or DQ8 haplotype, encoded by DQA1*03:01 and DQB1*03:02 [ 4 ]., whereas the most prominent association of CD is with HLA-DQ2.5 molecules [ 5 ]. The alleles encoding DQ2.5 molecule are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-DRB1*03, while the DQ8 alleles are in LD with HLA-DRB1*04. More specifically, considering the subtype specificity, the DRB1*03:01 is found coupled to DQA1*05:01 and DQB1*02:01 almost exclusively, thus creating the haplotype called “DR3”, while DRB1*04:01 is found in LD with DQA1*03:01 but can have either DQB1*03:01 or DQB1*03:02 included in the haplotype. Both are referred to as “DR4” haplotypes, although that carrying the DQB1*03:02 allele (DQ8 haplotype) predisposes to disease and that with DQB1*03:01 allele (DQ7 haplotype) is protective [ 4 , 5 ]. T1D risk depends not only on the haplotypic context but also on the genotypic assets of the risk alleles. In fact, the highest risk is conferred by DR3/DR4 heterozygous genotype. The contribution of DR3/DR4 is higher than the sum of the individual DR3 and DR4 haplotypes. This group comprised T1D subjects carrying DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02 on one chromosome and DRB1*04:01-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 on the other chromosome. One hypothesis for the increased risk is the putative presence of DQ heterodimers encoded by alleles in trans, in addition to the DQ molecules encoded by alleles in cis, on the cell surface of immune cells [ 6 , 7 ].
