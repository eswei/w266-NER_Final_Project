 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be unusually upregulated or downregulated in various human cancers. For instance, miR-21 was upregulated in colorectal cancer ( 5 ), while miR-126 was downregulated in lung cancer ( 6 ). Moreover, the dysregulated expression of miRNAs was also closely-associated with the pathogenesis and development of cancers ( 7 ). In OS, downregulation of miR-375, miR-302b and miR-216a was detected in previous studies (8–10). Furthermore, the upregulation of miR-19, miR-92b and miR-146a was found in OS (11–13). Therefore, miRNAs participated in the tumorigenesis of OS, as indicated in previous studies. Specifically, the decrease of miR-202 expression was identified in gastric cancer ( 14 ), colorectal carcinoma ( 15 ) and endometrial adenocarcinoma ( 16 ). Those studies indicated that miR-202 also affects the progression of OS. However, the specific function of miR-202 in OS has yet to be analysed.
