 Along with alterations in the lipid profiles during aortic aneurysm development, we also demonstrated alterations in lipid profiles in normal areas of the aortic media in both TAAA and TNAA, when compared with CNTAs without vascular disease. These alterations were similar between TAAA and TNAA; therefore, these lipid alterations could represent risky transitional markers of the aortic media leading to thoracic aortic aneurysm, although we cannot rule out the possibility that these alterations may be attributed to age. During the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms, decreased ePE and increased PGD₂ and 5-LOX metabolites were also observed. In addition, increased GCers and LPCs and decreased TGs and 12- and 15-LOX metabolites were noted in the aortic media of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) has been shown to mediate platelet-derived growth factor-directed migration of VSMCs ³⁵ . Moreover, GCers and LPCs can activate ERK signalling in VSMCs ³⁶ , ³⁷ . Thus, increased GCers and LPCs may represent the enhanced migratory activity of VSMCs by activating ERK signalling, which indicates the status of VSMCs in the aortic media leading to thoracic aortic aneurysm development. In the normal aortic media prior to thoracic aortic aneurysm development, 5-LOX metabolites increased, but 12- and 15-LOX metabolites decreased. Although the pathological implications of these lipid alterations have not been clarified, 5-HETE and 12- HETE/15-HETE have been shown to have opposite effects on insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets ³⁸ . Thus, 12- and 15-HETE may also counteract 5-HETE in the initiation and development of thoracic aortic aneurysms, and imbalances may enhance the risk of initiation of thoracic aortic aneurysms.
