 Considering the clinical course of aceruloplasminemia, anemia and diabetes mellitus are the early clinical signs. In aceruloplasminemia patients, anemia appears as microcytic anemia with decreased serum iron and elevated serum ferritin levels ( 5 ). In patients with iron-deficiency anemia, the screening of the serum ferritin level is crucial. While iron-deficiency anemia results in decreased serum iron and ferritin levels, aceruloplasminemia results in elevated ferritin levels with decreased serum iron levels. In iron overload syndromes, such as aceruloplasminemia, oral iron therapy might therefore accelerate the occurrence of liver damage. Therefore, the screening of the serum ferritin levels is necessary before initiating any therapy for microcytic anemia. Additionally, diabetes mellitus needs insulin for the control of the blood glucose levels, as in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( 10 , 13 , 27 ). Although the combination of several therapies has been used for the treatment of these symptoms, the effectiveness of these therapies has been shown to be poor, as in the case of phlebotomy therapy for liver hemosiderosis. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibility of aceruloplasminemia when encoutering cases with intractable anemia and diabetes mellitus in order to make an early diagnosis.
