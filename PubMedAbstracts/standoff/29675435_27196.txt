 Numerous studies have suggested a direct relationship between IL-13 and lipid metabolism, especially in the scenario of metabolic dysfunction. For instance, a recent work demonstrated that PBMC show increased IL-13 expression in type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients that also exhibit hypertriglyceridemia [ 35 ]. Similarly, overweight and obese pregnant women with gestational hypertension show increased IL-13 concentration, which in turn is associated with elevated triglyceride levels [ 36 ]. Moreover, metabolic syndrome subjects exhibit increased serum IL-13 that is also correlated with rising concentration of blood sugar and triglycerides [ 37 ]. Our data expand on this body of work by revealing that circulating levels of IL-13 are strongly correlated with triglyceride values in insulin-resistant individuals. Interestingly, Tsao and coworkers previously demonstrated that IL-4, another Th2 cytokine with a similar structure and function to IL-13, is able to induce lipolysis in 3T3L1 adipocytes, thus increasing glycerol release and secretion into the culture supernatant [ 38 ]. This work concurs with our findings and reveals a novel function of Th2 cytokines in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism; however, there is no evidence yet exploring whether IL-13 may have a similar effect to IL-4. Further research is needed to evaluate the possible role of IL-13 in lipid metabolism and identify novel molecular targets with the aim of reducing triglyceride levels and cardiovascular risk in patients with insulin resistance.
