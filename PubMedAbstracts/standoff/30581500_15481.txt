 Although the CYS-C might be impacted by nonrenal factors such as age, gender, and race, this study found that baseline serum CYS-C concentration was significantly increased in acute pancreatitis patients with AKI compared to that without AKI, suggesting that the increased baseline serum CYS-C might be associated with AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, baseline serum CYS-C is an independent and significant indicator for AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis according to multivariate logistic regression analysis. AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis could be identified with a sensitivity of 88.9% at specificity of 100% (AUC = 0.948, 95% CI 0.879â€“1.000) by serum baseline CYS-C (cut-off value = 1.865 mg/L) in our study group. Our finding suggested that baseline serum CYS-C can be a biomarker for AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis. Compared with RIFLE and KDIGO guideline, measurement of baseline serum CYS-C may be an early indicator predicting AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used routinely in clinical laboratories. If our results are confirmed by other groups, this marker can easily be applied to clinical practice for predicting the occurrence of AKI in patients with acute pancreatitis.
