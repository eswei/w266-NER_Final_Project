 In addition, we used the online analysis system String to predict potential and functional partners (Figure 10). Finally, ten genes were predicted. The highest score of association was IL-21R (Score = 0.996), however, IL-6R had the lowest scores (Score = 0.833). Tan et al. [ 35 ] employed RNA sequencing technology to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of RA patients compared with healthy volunteers. Combined DEGs and bioinformatics analysis indicated that the cytokine imbalance relevant to key molecules: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, tumor necrosis factor, colony-stimulating factor 3, IL-6 and interferon gene (IFNG) were responsible for the common comprehensive mechanism of RA [ 35 ]. van Steenbergen et al. [ 36 ] reported that IL2RA-rs2104286 and soluble IL2Rα-level were associated with RA-persistence, which was known to act as a protective factor against multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and RA. Li et al. [ 37 ] indicated the −590 site and −174 site polymorphisms in the promoter of IL-4 and IL-6, respectively, may be associated with increased risk of RA and could be used as genetic markers for assessing the susceptibility and severity of RA. O’Doherty et al. [ 38 ] suggested that TT genotype in IL-7 rs6897932 polymorphism was significantly associated with RA risk. Gomes da Silva et al. [ 39 ] suggested that the variants +2199 A/C IL-23R could contribute to RA development. Paradowska-Gorycka et al. [ 40 ] indicated that IL-12p40 + 1188A/C polymorphism and IL-12p70 protein levels may be associated with RA. Above information predicted IL family genes, such as IL2A, IL4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-23R, IL-12 and IFNG may influence IL-21 and regulate the RA development, which maybe become intervention and treatment target genes in the future. Besides, Do et al. [ 41 ] reported that IL-21 was dispensable for γδ T-cell IL-17A expression in lymph nodes, while Moser et al. [ 42 ] indicated that IL-21R signaling suppressed the IL-17A-producing γδ T-cell response in lung after influenza A virus infection. In addition, Huang et al. [ 43 ] suggested IL-21/IL-21R may act as a potent inhibitor of IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, controlling neutrophil-dependent inflammatory responses mediated by IL-17A-producing γδ T cells. From above we can see, IL-21 is a significant regulator for IL-17A.
