 It was further revealed that Smad2 was the potential target of miR-18a-5p, and in addition, it was determined that miR-18a-5p negatively regulated the expression of Smad2 and Smad4, and positively regulated the expression of Smad7. Studies have confirmed that Smad2 and Smad4 are two major downstream regulators in the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and both of them act as tumor suppressors in many human cancers, while Smad7 serves as a negative feedback regulator of this pathway ( 14 , 15 ). Numerous studies have demonstrated that the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway is an important pathogenic mechanism in various cancers, such as breast ( 16 ), prostate ( 17 ), and gastric cancer ( 18 ), as well as hepatocellular carcinoma ( 19 ) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( 14 ). Thus, we speculated that miR-18a-5p may promote OSCC cancer cell biological progression though activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and it may be an important therapeutic strategy for OSCC. Furthermore, our results indicated that miR-18a-5p could increase the expression of collagen I, α-SMA and vimentin, but decrease E-cadherin expression. While miR-18a-5p inhibitor presented the opposite effects. It is well recognized, that collagen I as one of extracellular matrix components, plays an important role cancer cell infiltration and metastasis ( 20 ). α-SMA has been revealed to be a negative prognostic marker and associated with cancer metastases ( 21 ). Vimentin is now being perceived as a canonical prognostic marker and has been revealed to have a high expression level in many cancers ( 22 ). Previous studies have demonstrated that E-cadherin, a well-known tumor suppressor protein ( 23 ), is involved in the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway ( 24 ). All these findings were consistent with our present study. Thus, our findings indicated that high expression of miR-18a-5p may indicate a poor prognosis.
