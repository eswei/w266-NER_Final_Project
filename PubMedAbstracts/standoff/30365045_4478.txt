 Recently, researchers have revealed that exosomal miR-155-5p served an important role in the regulation of chemoresistance. Challagundla et al ( 22 ) firstly reported that exosomal miR-155-5p mediated cross-talk between monocyte and neuroblastoma cells to promote cancer cell chemoresistance. In addition, Patel et al ( 23 ) and Mikamori et al ( 24 ) revealed that miR-155-5p expression levels were upregulated in cancer cells and their exosomes following exposure to gemcitabine. Exosomes derived from gemcitabine-treated pancreatic cancer cells mediated the acquisition of chemo-resistance via the delivery of miR-155-5p into the sensitive cells ( 23 , 24 ). Additionally, Santos et al ( 25 ) reported that doxorubicin (DOX)- and paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells transmitted chemoresistance to neighboring cancer cells by exosomal delivery of miR-155-5p. These findings suggested that exosomal miR-155-5p may be a very important signaling molecule to transmit chemoresistance from drug-resistant to drug-sensitive cancer cells; however, the role and mechanism of chemoresistant cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-155-5p in this process require further investigation. Whether exosomal miR-155-5p mediates the transmission of paclitaxel resistance in gastric cancer cells remains unknown.
