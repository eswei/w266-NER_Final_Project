 LncRNAs are a large group of noncoding RNAs with no protein-coding ability. Increasing evidence indicates a close relationship between lncRNA expression and cancer development. For instance, lncRNA NEAT1 regulates ovarian cancer cell resistance to paclitaxel through promoting ZEB1 expression [ 22 ], and lncRNA ZFAS1 targets miR-484 to increase proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer [ 23 ]. Previous studies suggest HOTTIP is a key regulator of cancer development and drug resistance in various cancers, including thyroid carcinoma [ 15 ], small cell lung cancer [ 24 ], and colorectal cancer [ 16 ]. In addition, Fu et al. reported that HOTTIP regulates the stem cell property of pancreatic cancer cells [ 25 ]. Zhang et al. showed that HOTTIP accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in glioma through the miR-101/ZEB1 pathway [ 26 ]. Lin et al. reported that HOTTIP promotes growth and invasion in esophageal squamous carcinoma [ 27 ]. This evidence demonstrates that HOTTIP serves as oncogene. However, the role of HOTTIP in NPC is unclear. We showed that HOTTIP promoted NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating HOTTIP also acts as an oncogene in NPC. Moreover, our results indicate that HOTTIP might be a potential prognostic marker for NPC patients.
