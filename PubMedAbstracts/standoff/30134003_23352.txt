 One of the interesting cross‐regulatory mechanisms between lncRNAs and miRNAs is the function of a competing endogenous RNA or a molecular sponge.22 For instance, Wang et al. have found that DLEU1 contributes to ovarian carcinoma tumourigenesis and progression by interacting with miR‐490‐3p and altering CDK1 expression. Cui et al. have reported that lncRNA CCAT1 promotes glioma tumourigenesis by sponging miR‐181b, thereby leading to derepression of its endogenous targets FGFR3 and PDGFRα; these findings point to a potential therapeutic target in glioma.23, 24 A recent study verified that LINC00312 is associated with miR‐197‐3p and modulates the expression of a miR‐197‐3p target, p120, thereby providing powerful evidence that LINC00312 enhances gene expression at the post‐transcriptional level.20 Here, we revealed a potential binding site within LINC00312 and miR‐21 by bioinformatic prediction. Given that miR‐21 is overexpressed in CRC25, 26, 27 and promotes cell growth and invasion by repressing PTEN in CRC,15, 17 we hypothesized that LINC00312 might function as a miR‐21 sponge to enhance PTEN expression. Our luciferase reporter assay showed that miR‐21 is a direct interaction partner of LINC00312 in CRC cells. LINC00312 significantly suppressed miR‐21 expression, enhanced PTEN expression and decreased p‐AKT level. Furthermore, miR‐21 mimics attenuated the inhibitory effects of LINC00312 on CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion; these phenomena were similar to the effects of PTEN siRNA on LINC00312‐overexpressing cells. These findings suggest that the miR‐21–PTEN pathway is involved in the LINC00312‐controlled malignant progression of CRC.
