 The transcription products of most genes in the human genome are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) 4 . Based on the length of ncRNAs fragments, they are divided into short non-coding RNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The short non-coding RNAs mainly include microRNAs (miRNAs), short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) 5 . piRNAs are a class of newly discovered small RNA molecules of 26-31nt in length and generally function by binding to the Argonaute protein family (i.e., the PIWIL protein subfamily) for gene silencing and regulation as well as maintenance of the germline DNA stability. Human PIWI protein members include: PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3 and PIWIL4 6 . PIWI proteins find their target RNAs by using piRNAs as guides and cleave the targets through the RNase (slicer) activity of the PIWI domain. PIWIL3 expression is deregulated in multiple cancers. Recent studies of single-cell proteomics have demonstrated that PIWIL3 is highly expressed in human oocytes and is associated with development and maturation 7 . It has been reported that PIWIL3 is aberrantly expressed in breast and gastric carcinoma 8 , 9 and is related to the prognosis of breast cancer and may serve as a new indicator for prognosis 8 .PIWIL3 has been shown to be highly expressed in stage III human ovarian epithelial cancer and its metastatic tissues 10 . Also, the human protein atlas (<url>) shows that PIWIL3 is down-regulated in gliomas. Moreover, piRNA microarray analysis showed that piRNADQ570076 (referred to as piR-30188 in NCBI genebank) is down-regulated in U87 and U251 glioma cells. However, the regulatory role and potential mechanisms of PIWIL3 and piR-30188 affecting the biological behavior of glioblastoma have not been investigated.
