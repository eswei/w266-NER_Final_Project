 STAT3 is a crucial and well-known mediator of malignant progression in CRC [ 9 , 10 ]. An ever-increasing number of reports correlate excessive GP130/STAT3 signaling with the progression of colon cancer [ 11 ]. Once activated, it plays a critical role in the oncogenesis, proliferation, metastasis and invasion of colon cancers by up-regulating the expression of downstream genes, including cyclin D1, c-myc, bcl-XL, survivin etc. Thus far, a series of STAT3-activating cytokines that promote colon cancer has been identified [ 3 ]. IL-11, a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, has been recently identified as potentially the most important cytokine in promoting colon cancer through exclusive utilization of GP130 homodimers when bound to its receptor, IL-11R [ 12 ]. The interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines comprises 10 members: IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), neuropoietin (NP), oncostatin M (OSM), IL-27, and IL-31 [ 13 ]. IL-11 and IL-6 are the only known cytokines that initiate signal transduction via a GP130 homodimer; all other cytokines utilize heterodimers of GP130 in combination with a second signal-transducing receptor [ 14 ]. In classic signaling, IL-11 binds to the membrane-bound IL-11R to initiate signal transduction. Recently, it was found that IL-11 signaling can also be initiated via soluble IL-11R, known as trans-signaling [ 15 ]. Upon the formation of IL-11/IL-11R/GP130 hexameric complex, IL-11 mainly mediated cancer development through the induction and activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway [ 16 â€“ 18 ]. It has already been found to contribute to tumorigenesis in several types of solid malignancies [ 19 , 20 ]. In colon cancer, the up-regulated IL-11 and IL-11R were also found to be highly expressed in samples of CRC patients [ 21 ]. The dominance of IL-11 over IL-6 as the cytokine enabling tumor outgrowth from the gastrointestinal epithelium also extends into clinically more prevalent situations that occur independently of overt inflammation and/or colitis. Accordingly, low IL-11 levels correlate with reduced resistance toward chemotherapy of some solid cancers. Several studies have emphasized the potential tumorigenic role of IL-11 in colon cancer as well as its potential role as a target in colon cancers [ 3 , 22 ]. IL-11 has a stronger correlation with elevated STAT3 activation in human gastrointestinal cancers. All these findings demonstrate that therapeutic inhibition of IL-11/GP130 signaling can be used for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.
