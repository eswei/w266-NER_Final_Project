 Studies reported that HlyA from E. coli and leukotoxin A from A. actinomycetemcomitans induce ATP release from RBCs by forming toxin pores. Released ATP then acts on P2X1 and P2X7 to mediate hemolysis [12,14,16]. ATP as a mediator, plays an important role in HlyA- and leukotoxin A-induced hemolysis. ATP was found to be released from ETX-treated RBCs. However, our results indicated that the ATP-scavengers apyrase and hexokinase could not inhibit ETX-induced hemolysis. It therefore appeared that ATP was not involved in the activation of P2 receptors. This may also explain why OxATP was not effective in inhibiting ETX-induced hemolysis. Since ATP and ATP derivatives share structural similarities, ATP derivatives such as OxATP may potentially impair P2X7 activation by binding to the ATP binding site. OxATP cannot impair P2X7 activation if ATP is not involved in P2X7 activation. We also demonstrated that the release of ATP was caused by hemolysis rather than ETX-formed pores or pannexin 1. In addition, we found that the extent of ATP release tightly correlated with the extent of hemolysis (Figure 6(h)). Taken together, we concluded that ATP release is the result of ETX-induced hemolysis rather than a mediator of ETX-induced hemolysis (Figure 8). Hence, the mechanism of ETX-induced hemolysis is different from those of HlyA- and leukotoxin A-induced hemolysis. It was also reported that hemolysis is a primary ATP-release mechanism in human erythrocytes stimulated by several stimuli, including shear stress and hypoxia [37]. Figure 8. Inferred model for ETX-induced hemolysis. ETX first bound to membrane of human erythrocytes and formed pores; secondly, a series of signal transduction occurred and led to P2 receptorâ€™s activation; thirdly, activation of P2 receptors led to hemolysis, which caused the release of ATP.
