 Adipokines are a group of adipose tissue-derived bioactive molecules that are important in regulating diverse processes such as appetite, metabolism, fat distribution, insulin activity, and inflammation [ 8 ]. Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin are known adipokines. Adiponectin has anti-diabetic properties because it increases insulin sensitivity by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress [ 9 , 10 ]. The insulin-sensitizing properties of adiponectin are important in maintaining the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism [ 9 ]. Low adiponectin levels are closely associated with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, and cardiovascular risk [ 11 ]. Leptin is an adipose tissue-specific adipokine, and it acts as a sensing factor to regulate appetite, glucose homeostasis, energy metabolism, and immune cell functions [ 10 , 12 ]. Leptin is a pro-inflammatory adipokine because it stimulates the activation of monocytes/macrophages and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 12 ]. Leptin also increases ROS production and oxidative stress, which might explain the recently reported increases in cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients [ 12 ]. Elevated leptin levels are therefore considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Resistin is an important mediator of cardiovascular and metabolic pathogenesis. High resistin levels are associated with inflammation [ 13 ], lead to vascular cell dysfunction, and induce ROS synthesis in various cells [ 14 ]. Indeed, a previous study found that poor clinical outcomes were associated with diabetic patients that had significantly elevated serum resistin levels [ 15 ].
