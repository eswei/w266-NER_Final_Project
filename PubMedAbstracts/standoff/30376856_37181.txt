 ATF3 may play different roles in various tumors. Li et al. [ 28 ] found that ATF3 was reduced in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) compared with non-tumor adjacent tissues and ATF3 suppressed ESCC via downregulation of ID1. In bladder cancer, ATF3 suppresses metastasis of bladder cancer by regulating gelsolin-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton [ 11 ]. Reactivation of ATF3 by pracinostat is a determining factor in the tumor response to the HDACi therapy and ATF3 was a biomarker of tumor response [ 29 ]. On the other hand, upregulation of ATF3 in lung cancer could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [ 30 ]. ATF3 plays contradictory functions in different diseases may be due to the complex tumor microenvironment, such as the community of genomically altered cancer cells, non-neoplastic cells, and a diverse collection of microorganisms, as well as complex crosstalk of intracellular molecules and multi-module activated signal transduction pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma, ATF3 expression is lower in patients with advanced HCC and capsule invasion [ 8 ]. Consistent with this result, our clinical pathological analysis indicated that ATF3 was relatively downregulated in cancerous tissues compared with corresponding noncancerous liver tissues. However, we observed that ATF3 was negatively correlated with intrahepatic metastasis and was positively associated with the OS of HCC patients (Fig. 7). Our experiments further confirmed that ATF3 could suppress HCC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.
