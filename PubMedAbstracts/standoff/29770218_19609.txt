 Finding diagnostic markers of psychiatric illness is an interesting area of research. In many earlier studies, peripheral biomarkers were planned for different psychiatric diseases. Fındıklı et al. ⁴⁴ demonstrated that serum levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) had a prognostic value for the existence of anxiety and GPER1 receptor action can be an applicant marker for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Bulut et al. ⁴⁵ examined paraoxonase action in patients with GAD, and the AUC value was 0.980. Camkurt et al. ⁸ indicated an AUC value of 1.0 for MDA in MDD patients. Moreover, Güneş et al. ⁴⁶ identified that prolidase was a decent marker for schizophrenia (AUC: 1.0). Selek et al. ⁴⁷ also stated very good diagnostic performance for both prolidase (AUC: 0.989) and catalase (AUC: 0.989). Now, a rising body of evidence occurs concerning the diagnostic performance of many peripheral biomarkers in mental illness. From this point of view, our study found that MDA and cortisol levels had significant diagnostic values for major depression (AUC: 0.853 and 0.819, p < 0.001). We do not make an interpretation from this; MDA and cortisol are unique diagnostic indicators for MDD. Nevertheless, as we clarified above, amplified MDA and cortisol look like a dependable result for MDD in most of the patients. By adding our findings to the earlier information, we prudently infer that MDA and cortisol levels could be the applicant markers for MDD. We recommend further works in the similar field should emphasis on greater and more similar samples to detect whether MDA and cortisol could be indicators for depression. The limitations of this study are the lack of food intake data of study population and the single measurement of cortisol.
