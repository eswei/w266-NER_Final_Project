 From the panel of consistently deregulated miRNAs, several were recently associated with cancer progression and prognosis. Most notably, miRNAs hsa-mir-21 and -196b are well established oncomirs [ 56 ], and hsa-mir-196a is known to be associated with NSCLC [ 57 ]. The role of hsa-mir-30a varies across human cancer types [ 58 ]. Hsa-mir-135b reverses chemoresistance of NSCLC [ 59 ]. Hsa-mir-139 is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and disease progression in breast cancer [ 60 ], and is believed to inhibit bladder cancer proliferation and self-renewal [ 61 ]. Hsa-mir-143 inhibits tumor growth of breast cancer [ 62 ]. Hsa-mir-144 has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells [ 63 ]. Hsa-mir-182 promotes prostate cancer progression [ 64 ]. Hsa-mir-195 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells [ 65 ]. Hsa-mir-218 downregulation contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor metastasis in lung cancer [ 66 ]. Hsa-mir-130b is a part of the new prognostic marker for patient risk assessment and as an indicator of therapy resistance in prostate cancer [ 67 ]. Similarly, hsa-mir-183 in combination with hsa-mir-19b were recently proposed as biomarkers of lung cancer [ 68 ], and miRNAs hsa-mir-145 and -9 as biomarkers for early-stage cervical cancer [ 69 ].
