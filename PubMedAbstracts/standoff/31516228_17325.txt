 In our study, the p-16 immunoexpression was identified in 47.4% of the premalignant cases and 37.3% of malignant cases with maximal positivity in OIN III lesions (77.8%). Hence, we found increased immunoexpression with increasing grades of dysplasia with OIN I lesions showing positive p-16 immunoexpression in only 16.7% of cases as compared to 25% in OIN II and 77.8% in OIN III. Majority of malignant lesions displayed lower p-16 immunoexpression than OIN III lesions. Only the poorly differentiated tumors had high proportion of cases with positive p-16 immunostaining. This is in contrast to other studies who have found low to absent p-16 immunoexpression at the level of the invasion front of poorly differentiated tumors.[ 11 12 ] Similar to our study, Angiero et al. have demonstrated an increase in p-16 expression in higher grades of dysplasia and invasive oral squamous cell tumors.[ 13 ] Dragomir et al., 2012[ 14 ] and Gologan et al.[ 15 ] found that the positivity index and the intensity of reaction were increased at the level of dysplastic epithelium for p-16 but reduced in tumor and their invasion front. Still, others have not found any correlation between p-16 immunoexpression and tumoral grade and stage.[ 16 17 ] Although the literature shows conflicting results for oral lesions without any consensus, our present study infers that p-16 immunoexpression and pattern correlates with the malignant transformation in oral and oropharyngeal lesions with increased immunoexpression in increasing degrees of dysplasia.
