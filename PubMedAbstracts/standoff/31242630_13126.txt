 As a novel discovery, urinary levels of HE4 were significantly higher in the TAC–AKI group than in the non-AKI group during post-transplantation tacrolimus treatment. HE4 is a secreted protein encoded by the WFDC2 gene, which is located on chromosome 20q12-131 [ 30 ]. It reproducibly identifies epithelial ovarian cancers, endometrial carcinomas, and lung malignancies, [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] and is a potential biomarker for renal fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and chronic kidney disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [ 31 , 32 ]. The physiological and pathological functions of HE4 are not completely understood. HE4 is upregulated in fibrotic kidneys where it promotes renal fibrosis by suppressing the activity of serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases and, consequently, the degradation of type I collagen [ 31 ]. In patients with kidney allografts, elevated HE4 levels may induce renal fibrosis [ 33 ] and increase the severity of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular cell damage [ 34 ]. The increase in HE4 urinary levels, but not NGAL urinary levels, in the TAC–AKI group suggests that tacrolimus induces AKI by triggering the release of cytokines and chemokines, which exacerbate tubular injury. HE4 may also contribute to interstitial fibrosis by stimulating myoblast differentiation.
