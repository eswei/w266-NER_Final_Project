 HMGA2 is a nuclear-binding protein that plays key regulators in cell growth and invasion. In gastric cancer development and progression, HMGA2 was identified as oncogenes in previous study. Elevated HMGA2 expression levels were significantly associated with poor clinical prognosis [ 19 ]. HMGA2-FOXL2 axis regulates metastases and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of chemo-resistant gastric cancer [ 20 ]. HMGA2 regulates epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition and the acquisition of tumor stem cell properties through TWIST1 in gastric cancer [ 21 ]. HMGA2 could promote vasculogenic mimicry and tumor aggressiveness by upregulating Twist1 in gastric carcinoma [ 22 ]. In GC, the other targets of miR-503 showed little report. Li showed that upregulation of circular RNA circ-ERBB2 predicts unfavorable prognosis and facilitates the progression of gastric cancer via miR-503/CACUL1 signaling [ 23 ]. Our results indicated that HMGA2 is a target of miR-503 in GC, and HMGA2 overexpression promoted GC cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, HMGA2 overexpression mediated the inhibiting effects by miR-503 on GC cell proliferation and invasion (Fig. 8).
