 It can be found in this study that levels of TSH, FPG and HbAIc in GDM and SCH pregnant women were significantly higher than those in normal pregnant group; the levels of 25-OH-D and Ca2+ in GDM and SCH pregnant women were significantly lower than those in normal pregnant group. With the increase of 25-OH-D level, through the comparison of levels of FPG, TSH, and Ca2+ in different groups, the levels of FPG, TSH, and HbAIc in the 25-OH-D deficient group were lower than those in the 25-OH-D sufficient group. However, Ca2+ levels reduced compared with those in 25-OH-D deficient group and sufficient group. The positive rates of TPOAb and TgAb in GDM and SCH pregnant women were higher than normal pregnant women. Pregnant women with TPOAb or TgAb positive have a higher rate of VitD deficiency than TPOAb or TgAb negative pregnant women. When the serum 25-OH-D of GDM and SCH pregnant women is at a low level, it may cause humoral immune function disorders, and increase the demand for VitD, to result in 25-OH-D level decline and VitD deficiency. It is the current situation that GDM and SCH pregnant women have VitD deficiency problem. Therefore, serum 25-OH-D can be used as an important monitoring index for GDM and SCH.
