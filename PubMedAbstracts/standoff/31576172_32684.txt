 KLF4 belongs to the Kruppel family of transcription factors, which encode zinc finger proteins required for normal development of the barrier function of skin. 19 Accumulative evidence have uncovered the critical roles of KLF4 in a number of human malignancies. For instance, Nagata et al proposed that KLF4 and NANOG possessed prognostic biomarker value for triple-negative breast cancer. 20 Zhao et al demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG5/miR-32 axis-regulated gastric cancer cell proliferation and migration by targeting KLF4. 21 In bladder cancer cells, Minami et al uncovered that miR-145 negatively regulated Warburg effect by silencing KLF4 and PTBP1. 22 Yan et al reported that KLF4-mediated suppression of CD44 signaling negatively impacted pancreatic cancer stemness and metastasis. 23 Wei et al characterized that KLF4 was essential for induction of cellular identity change and acinar-to-ductal reprogramming during early pancreatic carcinogenesis. 23 In colorectal carcinoma, Zhai et al showed miR-543 promoted cancer proliferation and metastasis by targeting KLF4. 24 Ma et al unraveled that KLF4 inhibited CRC cell proliferation dependent on NDRG2 signaling. 25 Xu et al provided evidence that over-expression of KLF4 promoted cell senescence through miR-203-survivin-p21 pathway. 26 Consistent with the well-acknowledged anti-tumor properties of KLF4 in CRC, here we for the first time displayed that KLF4 was directly involved in miR-153-1 transcription, which eventually contributed to its tumor suppressor function. Noteworthily, while most investigations focused on the downstream regulatory network of dysregulated microRNAs, here we bioinformatically predicted and experimentally identified KLF4 as the transcription factor of miR-153-1.
