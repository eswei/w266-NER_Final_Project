 At present, some mechanisms of the effect of TMAO in cardiovascular diseases have been proposed. In the pathological process of atherosclerosis, TMAO accelerated endothelial dysfunction through the activation of PKC/NF-κB/VCAM-1 ( Ma et al., 2017 ). TMAO has also been found to reverse GFP-PDS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum perturbation, contributing to endoplasmic reticulum balance ( Shepshelovich et al., 2005 ). Previous studies revealed that TMAO may exacerbate cardiac fibrosis and inflammation induced by high glucose levels via upregulating the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β ( Chen K. et al., 2017 ). Li et al. (2018) showed that gut microbe-derived metabolite TMAO induced transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis involving Smad3 signaling. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. However, the biological role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in TMAO-induced cardiac fibrosis is still unclear. Our results indicated for the first time that TMAO induced cardiac fibrosis through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in cardiac fibrosis after TMAO treatment. In addition, we showed that inhibition of NLRP3 could reverse TMAO-mediated cardiac fibrosis, indicating a potential target for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.
