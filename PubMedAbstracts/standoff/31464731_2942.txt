 Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a multimeric acute phase protein of the pentraxin superfamily that serves as a proinflammatory biomarker. It is usually secreted in several cells, including macrophages, fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells [ 4 ]. In CAD patients, PTX3 is released from activated platelets and neutrophils [ 5 ] and is associated with the progress of coronary atherosclerotic lesions [ 6 ]. Galectins and β-galactoside-binding animal lectins are differentially excreted by various immune cells and by a wide range of other cells. The galectins are divided into three types: prototype, chimera, and tandem. Galectin-3 (GAL-3) is one of the chimera members. It is secreted by activated macrophages [ 7 ] and is crucial in physiological and pathological processes, including cell growth, angiogenesis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation. GAL-3 might be closely correlated with heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality [ 8 ]. As a well-known potent inhibitor of plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis, the concentration of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) increases in the patients with atherosclerosis [ 9 ], making it a putative CAD risk factor. Recently, retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) has been linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, and it can transport the protein for vitamin A [ 10 ]. Moreover, RBP4 is crucial in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis in CAD patients [ 11 ]. Adiponectin (ADP) is a classical anti-inflammatory cytokine, a peptide hormone, and a member of the adipokines family that was first discovered in 1995 [ 12 ]. ADP can protect the cardiovascular systems from atherosclerosis by inhibiting the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), reducing monocyte adhesion, and repairing endothelial cells [ 13 , 14 ]. As a new member of the interleukin (IL) family, IL-37 often decreases in peripheral blood in healthy individuals. The overexpression of IL-37 in murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells leads to the reduction in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated proinflammatory cytokines [ 15 ]. Netrins play a vital role in cell migration and axon guidance. Netrin-1 (NTN1) is one of the five types of netrins, which acts as a bifunctional regulator in neuron migration [ 16 ]. In addition, NTN1 is involved in angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and anti-ischemia reperfusion injury, exerting a cardioprotective effect in CAD [ 17 ].
