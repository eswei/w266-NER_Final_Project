 The seemingly paradoxical role of GDF-15 in prostate cancer might be attributed to the biphasic regulation of GDF15 expression in early-stage of tumor development versus during tumor progression. Albeit GDF15 expression is downregulated in metastatic CRPCs compared to primary tumors, we found that the levels of GDF15 RNA and protein are higher in primary prostate tumors than in benign prostate tissues (S1 and S2 Figs). This is consistent with the report from a previous study, in which immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays containing over 1600 cores of benign prostate tissues, low- and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and primary prostate cancer samples showed a progressive increase of GDF15 protein levels from benign tissues to low- and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and to prostate cancer [ 60 ]. However, the same study showed that in prostate cancer samples, lower GDF15 expression is associated with higher Gleason pattern and pathologic stage and increased risk of relapse after surgery [ 60 ]. This biphasic regulation of GDF15 expression was also observed in another study, which demonstrated a higher level of GDF15 mRNA in prostate cancer than in benign prostate tissues but a lower level of GDF15 mRNA in moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas than in well-differentiated prostate cancer [ 61 ]. Therefore, the role of GDF15 in prostate cancer is likely to be stage specific. It may promote early stages of tumorigenesis but suppress the progression of advanced prostate cancer. Consequently, the role of GDF15 in mediating the growth-suppressive effects of MSA is likely to be specific to prostate cancer cells that are at an advanced stage.
