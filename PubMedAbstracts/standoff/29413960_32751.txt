 In conjunction with these observations, ethnicity and gender were found to be significant variables associated with total sulfide, ALS, and BSS with a diagnosis of CVD. Regression analyses show a significant reduction in plasma sulfide levels with onset of CVD in Caucasian patients. Notably, a significant association is observed with total sulfide, ALS, and BSS levels in females in comparison to the males in both Caucasians and African Americans. Additionally, SNP analysis of H₂S synthesis enzymes revealed that polymorphisms in CTH (but not CBS) are a potential risk factor for vascular disease development. It is known that CTH is a key enzyme for production of H₂S in the cardiovascular system. Others and we have previously reported that endogenous H₂S production is significantly reduced in CTH (CSE) deficient mice, which could translate to clinical implications for the development of vascular disease [9] , [34] . Deficiency in bioavailable sulfide may be associated with polymorphic variants of CTH as a previous report revealed an association of CTH SNP with increased serum homocysteine levels [16] . Our findings regarding CTH 1364 G-T allele frequency in patients with CVD advances the hypothesis that a CTH SNP 403Ser to 403Ile is associated with decreased sulfide bioavailability and has clinical associations in patients with chronic vascular disease conditions. However, future studies are needed to identify how this missense mutation alters enzyme function in vivo compared to a previous enzymatic study that did not find alterations in CTH pyridoxal-5’-phosphate cofactor content or steady state kinetic properties [36] .
