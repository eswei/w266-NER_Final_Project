 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level ² . Accumulating evidence suggests strong association between deregulated miRNAs and tumor radioresistance. For example, upregulation of let-7 miRNA is related to radioresistance in human glioma cell line ³ . MiR-34 is significantly upregulated in different human cell lines after radiation and associated with radioresistance in human prostate cancer cell lines ⁴ . MiR-21 is related to radioresistance in a variety of cancer cell lines, including breast ⁵ , lung ⁶ , ⁷ , glioblastoma ⁸ , and nasopharyngeal cancers ⁹ . Upregulation of miR-106b ¹⁰ and miR-100 ¹¹ can promote radioresistance in CRC. In our previous study, we found differentially expressed miRNAs in radiated CRC cells, such as miR-622 ¹² and miR-214. MiR-214, located in the chromosomal region 1q24.3, in intron 14 of the Dynamin-3 gene (DNM3), has been reported to be downregulated in several human cancers including breast cancer ¹³ , cervical cancer ¹⁴ , pancreatic cancer ¹⁵ , rhabdomyosarcoma ¹⁶ , and hepatocellular cancer ¹⁷ . Moreover, miR-214 modulates radiotherapy response of non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) via regulation of p38MAPK, apoptosis and senescence ¹⁸ . However, the function and mechanism of miR-214 on radioresistance in CRC remain unclear.
