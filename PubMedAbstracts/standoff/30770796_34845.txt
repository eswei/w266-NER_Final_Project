 Recent studies indicated that lncRNAs are frequently involved in the ceRNA network, where lncRNAs could regulate the miRNA target gene expression by binding miRNA and titrating off their binding with protein-coding messengers ²⁸ , ²⁹ . For instance, Linc01234 promotes gastric cancer progression by functioning as a ceRNA of miR-204-5p ³⁰ ; lncRNA UICLM mediated CRC liver metastasis by sponging to miR-215 to regulate the expression of ZEB1 ²² ; lncRNA HOXA11-AS promotes the cell proliferation through interacting with miR-1297 in gastric cancer ³¹ . In this study, we found that lncRNA ZNFX1-AS1 was mainly located in the cytoplasm and could be enriched by Ago2 in CRC cells, which implicates that lncRNA ZNFX1-AS1 might be involved in the ceRNA network. The online bioinformatics indicated and luciferase activity assay indicated miR-144 was sponged by lncRNA ZNFX1-AS1. miR-144 has been found to be downregulated in various tumors and generally functions as a tumor suppressor. Zhang and colleagues showed that miR-144 inhibits cancer metastasis by targeting ADAMTS5 and ADAM10 ³² . In another study, Ren et al indicated that miR-144 was down-regulated in Osteosarcoma, and ectopic expression of miR-144 inhibited cell proliferation, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo ³³ . In our study, we found that miR-144 was significantly down-regulated in CRC, ectopic expression of miR-144 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In accordance with our study, Iwaya et al found that down-regulation of miR-144 is associated with CRC progression via activation of the mTOR signaling pathway ³⁴ . Our results uncover the interaction between lncRNA ZNFX1-AS1 and miR-144 in mediating the progression of CRC.
