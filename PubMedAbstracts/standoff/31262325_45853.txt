 BEZ235 combined with the EGFR-targeting therapeutic, BIBW2992, also synergistically induced apoptosis in EGFR-T790 M mutant-expressing NSCLCs with acquired resistant to TKIs. BIBW2992 (afatinib) is a second-generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly blocks both wild-type and mutant forms of EGFR through formation of covalent bonds with Cys797 in the pocket of the catalytic site [ 5 ]. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is important in cell survival and is involved in the resistance to many cancer therapies, including RTK inhibitors [ 14 ]. It has been reported that the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BIM is responsible for EGFR-TKI–induced apoptosis in lung cancers harboring oncogenic EGFR mutations [ 49 ]. Moreover, BEZ235 has been shown to increase BIM expression in various cancers by acting through inhibition of PI3K/Akt activity to induce FOXO3a activity [ 34 , 50 , 51 ]. Targeting the EGFR-T790 M mutant and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are both strategies for reversing EGFR-TKI resistance [ 52 , 53 ]. In our study, we demonstrate that BEZ235 dramatically enhanced EGFR-TKI–induced apoptosis in EGFR-dependent NSCLCs, even those expressing the EGFR-T790 M mutant.
