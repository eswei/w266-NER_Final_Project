 The most common reason for such a high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with HDP is the unavailability of precise and specific test that can identify pregnant women at risk of developing HDP [ 9 ]. One such biochemical marker that can be used to assess the severity of HDP and its effect on the maternal and fetal outcome to a large extent is maternal serum uric acid level. The use of serum uric acid and its association with HDP and its severity was first reported in 1917 [ 10 ], and it is still considered as a marker of severity of HDP, as the disease severity was found to increase with increasing maternal serum uric acid levels [ 11 , 12 ]. Also, it was found that in HDP the elevation of uric acid occurs before the onset of hypertension and or proteinuria [ 13 , 14 ]. There are many reasons for raised serum uric acid levels in women with HDP, which include impaired clearance from kidneys, increased tissue breakdown, acidosis and increased activity of xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase enzyme [ 14 , 15 ]. The main reason behind impaired renal clearance of uric acid is reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased absorption and decreased secretion leading to raising serum uric acid levels in women with HDP [ 14 ]. In the first trimester of normal pregnancy serum, uric acid levels usually decrease to 3 mg/dl or more, under the uricosuric effects of estrogen and also due to increase renal blood flow. This is followed by an increase in levels of uric acid in the third trimester, reaching up to the levels of 4-5 mg/dl at term [ 16 ]. However, pregnant women who are prone to develop HDP, show slightly higher levels of serum uric acid during their first trimester [ 16 , 17 ]. Also, the degree of elevation of serum uric acid levels correlates with the severity of the disease and its outcome [ 16 ].
