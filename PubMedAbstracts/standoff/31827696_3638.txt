 The majority of studies reported that falsely elevated estradiol level during late pregnancy was one of the leading contributors to cause gestational cholestasis [ 15 , 16 ]. Thus, estradiol treatment during late pregnancy was usually used to induce gestational cholestasis in animals. High estradiol exposure during late pregnancy could dysregulate bile acid homeostasis through inhibiting hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activity [ 17 ]. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of gestational cholestasis in clinical practice. However, several animal experiments and epidemiological studies showed that UDCA did not alleviate gestational cholestasis-induced adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery [ 18 – 21 ]. The limited efficacy of UDCA in various cholestatic conditions urges for development of novel therapeutic approaches. Numerous studies recognized that excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) played an important role in cholestasis-induced liver injury and adverse fetal outcomes [ 22 – 24 ]. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a pharmaceutical currently in clinical trials to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and is also a synthetic agonist of FXR [ 25 , 26 ]. Moreover, an earlier research showed that OCA as a potent FXR ligand can protect against E217α cholestasis [ 27 ]. However, the effects of OCA on E217α cholestasis-induced fetal development have not been proved. FXR ligand is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is highly expressed in human and rodent animal placentas [ 28 , 29 ]. Several studies found that FXR has an antioxidant effect [ 30 , 31 ]. A recent study showed that OCA pretreatment protects against sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through inhibiting renal oxidative stress in mice [ 32 ]. Nevertheless, it is not known whether OCA treatment can alleviate gestational cholestasis-induced fetal IUGR.
