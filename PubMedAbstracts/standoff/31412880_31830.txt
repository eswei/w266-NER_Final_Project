 In this study, we found that HERV-E clone 4–1 3’LTR could act as natural miRNA sponges for miR-302d to restrain miR-302d activity. MiR-302d was proved to be downregulated in SLE patient monocytes and could inhibit the type I IFN pathway which was a major contributor to SLE pathogenesis via its target IRF-9 [ 21 ]. HERV-E clone 4–1 3’LTR could positively regulate MBD2 expression by acting as a ceRNA of MBD2 via miR-302d and HERV-E clone 4–1 3’LTR could induce DNA hypomethylation and IL-17 release via miR-302d/MBD2 in CD4⁺T cells of SLE. DNA hypomethylation of immune cells in SLE is associated with immune dysfunction and play important roles in the initiation and development of SLE [ 43 , 44 ]. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated T cells and plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis and represent an attractive therapeutic target for SLE [ 27 , 28 ]. Thus, we hold that HERV-E clone 4–1 takes part in disease pathogenesis of SLE through miR-302d/MBD2/DNA hypomethylation and IL-17 signaling via its 3’LTR. So, HERV-E clone 4–1 3’LTR may be a potential therapeutic target of SLE. Taken together, we draw a network diagram hypothesis showing relationship between HERV-E clone 4–1 and SLE which shows the important roles of HERV-E clone 4–1 in SLE pathogenesis (Fig. 6).
