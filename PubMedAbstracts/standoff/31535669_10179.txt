 Tumor angiogenesis is the pathological basis of decreased blood flow resistance and increased blood perfusion. VEGF165 is an important member of the VEGF family, with receptors on endothelial cells and tumor cell membranes. NPR-1, after combination, promotes endothelial cells tube structure, and can promote the growth of tumor cells [ 12 – 16 ]. SphK1 catalytic sphingosine phosphorylation of SIP is an important catalytic enzyme process. SIP, after combining with the membrane surface SIPR, can initiate downstream MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, which promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration and formation of tube-type structures [ 17 , 18 ]. CD31 is the vascular tight junction marker, and CD31 overexpression in vessels may play a key role in cancer development [ 19 , 20 ]. Under the combined action of VEGF165 and S1P, the formation of new blood vessels in breast cancer lesions is significantly increased. To assess the role of VEGF165 in breast lesions and to determine how S1P angiogenesis is mediated, we analyzed the angiogenic gene expression levels. The results showed that VEGF165, NRP-1, SphK1, and CD31 proteins expressions in the breast cancer groups were significantly higher compared with those of benign tumor patients; however, VEGF165, NRP-1, SphK1, and CD31 proteins levels in the III–IV stage group were higher than those of the I–II stage breast cancer group. Further analysis of the correlation between angiogenesis gene expression and blood flow characteristics showed the following: Vmax was positively correlated with VEGF165, NRP-1, SphK1, and CD31 proteins expressions and RI was negatively correlated with VEGF165, NRP-1, SphK1, and CD31 proteins expressions in breast cancer patients. This indicates that vascular neovascularization mediated by VEGF165, NRP-1, SphK1 and CD31 in breast cancer can reduce blood flow resistance and increase blood perfusion.
