 For the early diagnosis of cancer, several tumor biomarkers have been widely used in order to improve sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. Previous studies have demonstrated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to be both an important prognostic factor as well as an indicator of the therapeutic effect and recurrence in patients with rectal cancer 9 , 10 . CEA is produced in normal cells and at a higher level in the presence of certain cancers. Persistent elevation of CEA levels after surgery of colorectal cancer could indicate incomplete resection or occult metastatic disease, and it demonstrates a prognostic feature for relapse 11 . Some other serum tumor biomarkers, such as carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA 72-4), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) can also be elevated in tumors of the digestive system. CA 19-9 is a commonly researched tumor biomarker in gastric cancer. It has been investigated as a prognostic indicator or a predictive factor in patients with gastric cancer 12 . CA 72-4 was shown to be expressed in GC and CRC and it was considered to be more specific and sensitive than other bio-markers 13 , 14 . However, a combined diagnosis based on the levels of CEA, CA 19-9 and CA 72-4 was able to considerably improve sensitivity without impairing specificity.
