 Additionally, we extended previous findings showing that elevated circulating activin A levels are associated with cIMT in subjects with prediabetes and those with normal glucose levels. cIMT has been used as a surrogate marker not only of carotid atherosclerosis, but also of coronary atherosclerosis ²⁵ . The cIMT has been reported to be greater in subjects with abnormal glucose homeostasis, including impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and diabetes ²⁶ , ²⁷ . The cIMT was also associated positively with the incidence of cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes ²⁸ . Several possible rationales could explain the association between activin A and atherosclerosis. In addition to above-mentioned effects of activin A in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and glucose homeostasis, some experimental cardiovascular studies have revealed potential roles of activin A in inflammation and ischemia/reperfusion injury ¹⁴ , ¹⁷ , ²⁹ – ³¹ . Association of activin A and atherosclerosis has already been demonstrated in human vascular tissue specimens of atherosclerosis ³² . Increasing evidence suggests that activin A exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on peripheral mononuclear cells in patients with angina ¹⁴ . Overexpression of activin A with an adenoviral vector or treatment with recombinant activin A protein protected cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury ²⁹ . However, other studies have yielded contrasting findings ³⁰ , ³¹ . In a mouse cardiomyocyte ischemia/reperfusion model, activin A damaged cardiomyocytes independently of increased reactive oxygen species concentrations ³⁰ . Activin A was also shown to attenuate cardiomyocyte contractile function in adult rat cardiomyocyte cultures ³¹ . One could reasonably speculate that activin A plays similar roles in the development of NAFLD, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.
