 1. Introduction Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are cell membrane proteins comprising about 20 families with nearly 60 members. The Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family of human RTKs consists of four highly conserved transmembrane receptors (FGFR1–4) and one FGF receptor without an intracellular domain (FGFR5). FGFRs are mainly localized at the cell surface; however, they are also present inside of the cells, in the nucleus and mitochondria [ 1 ]. The common structure of cell membrane-localized FGFRs consists of a large ligand-binding extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a transmembrane helical region, and a cytoplasmic region with a catalytically active tyrosine kinase domain. The alternative splicing of the third Ig-like domain results in a variety of FGFR isoforms with different ligand specificities [ 2 , 3 ]. FGFR activity is modulated in diverse ways, including posttranslational modifications and formation of complexes with selected ligands and other cell membrane proteins [ 4 ]. Over 20 distinct fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been identified as the ligands of FGFRs. Binding of FGFs to FGFRs is assisted by cofactors, heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in paracrine FGF signaling, or Klotho coreceptor in endocrine signaling [ 5 ]. It triggers the dimerization of receptor monomers in the membrane and cross-autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic kinase domain, which is followed by binding of various downstream effector molecules, including phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), son of sevenless (SOS), and growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2). FRS2 is an adaptor/scaffold protein, which acts downstream of a limited number of RTKs, including FGFR [ 6 ]. FRS2 was annotated as amplified in skin-derived tumors in the Cancer Genome Project dataset [ 7 , 8 ] and emerged as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma [ 9 ]. Binding of adaptor proteins induces the activation of several signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5) signaling pathway (Figure 1).
