 Recently, a number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have investigated genetic markers of AD, including the genomic region of chromosome 4q22-q32, which includes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) cluster genes. 14 – 17 Furthermore, a recent GWAS of a Korean AD cohort revealed that three chromosomal regions are associated with AD, including the ADH gene cluster and ALDH2, which participate in alcohol metabolism (minimum P=6.46×10−⁸, OR =2.73 at ADH7 rs10516441 of the ADH gene cluster and P=8.42×10−⁸, OR =0.22 at ALDH2 rs671). The genetic effects of the ADH gene cluster were also replicated in a Korean population (minimum P=2.63×10−²¹ at ADH1B rs1229984). In addition to genes related to alcohol metabolism, genes known to participate in neurodevelopment, such as BRCA1-associated protein (BRAP) and protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8), have multiple association signals with the risk of AD (P=4.65×10−⁶, OR =0.31 at BRAP rs3782886 and P=1.77×10−⁵, OR =1.96 at PRMT8 rs876594). 18 Based on the polygenic hypothesis of AD pathophysiology, it is possible that multiple genetic loci associated with neurobiologic pathways could be associated with the risk of AD. Thus, the present investigation conducted followup replication studies of our previous GWAS of a Korean cohort with AD to identify associations between the risk of AD and novel candidate genes other than those related to alcohol metabolism.
