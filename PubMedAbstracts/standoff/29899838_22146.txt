 Previous studies showed that ACTH responsiveness is associated with somatic mutations in APA [ 9 ]. In an in vitro study, Kitamoto et al. reported that the responsiveness of aldosterone production to ACTH is higher in both ATP2B3- and CACNA1D-mutated APAs than in wild-type APAs [ 20 ]. In this study, no patients had APA with these mutations, while most had KCNJ5 mutations, although the number of surgical cases was small. A recent meta-analysis in Western countries showed that young age, female sex, and larger tumors are the phenotypic features of APA patients with KCNJ5 mutations [ 21 ]. Although the number of PA patients was small in this study, the size of tumors harboring mutated KCNJ5 (n = 11) was larger than that of wild-type KCNJ5 tumors (n = 5) (13.1 vs. 6.4, p = 0.009). However, we did not find any significant differences in age, sex, or laboratory data in patients with mutant versus wild-type KCNJ5 tumors. Furthermore, a previous study reported that KCNJ5 mutations are associated with a higher LI, thereby influencing AVS results [ 9 ]. In this study, the LI was higher in APA patients with somatic KCNJ5 mutations than in those without mutations on both pre- (13.4 vs. 7.0, p = 0.06) and post-ACTH AVS (8.2 vs. 4.7, p = 0.17), but not significantly. In addition, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with KCNJ5 mutations between the c-APA and pre-APA groups. These results suggest that somatic mutations in APA might not be related to the diagnostic discrepancy. Previous reports showed that the CYP11B2 H-score in APAs displayed a positive correlation with plasma aldosterone levels and the ARR, which reflect the biochemical severity of PA [ 13 ]. We investigated the relationship between the CYP11B2 immunostaining level in APAs and the AVS findings. However, there was no significant correlation.
