 Tumor cells are characterized by abnormally accelerated energy metabolism ( 6 ). Therefore, inhibition of energy metabolism is considered a promising treatment target for cancer therapy ( 7 ). Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), also termed facilitated glucose transporter member 1, is a uniporter protein that facilitates the transport of glucose to mammalian cells ( 8 ). A number of studies have reported that GLUT1 is abnormally upregulated in human cancer and promotes cancer development and progression by regulating cancer cell glucose metabolism ( 9 , 10 ). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical factors in cancer biology ( 11 ). MicroRNAs in certain cases participate in cancer biology by affecting energy metabolism ( 12 ), particularly by regulating the expression of GLUT1 ( 13 ). miRNA-10a has been characterized as an oncogenic miRNA in lung cancer ( 14 ). In lung cancer, miRNA-10a is upregulated and the overexpression of miRNA-10a promotes cancer development and progression via interactions with phosphatase and tensin homolog signaling ( 14 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the involvement of miRNA-10a in energy metabolism or the regulation of GLUT1 expression. The present study revealed that miRNA-10a may promote cancer cell proliferation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a major type of oral cancer, by serving as an upstream activator of GLUT1 and promoting glucose metabolism.
