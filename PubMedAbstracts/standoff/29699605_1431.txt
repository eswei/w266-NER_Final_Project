 Chitinase is an enzyme that degrades chitin macromolecules, which are long-chain polymers of N-acetylglucosamine, a component of cell walls in fungi and the exoskeletons of arthropods. Surprisingly, several chitinase and chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) have been identified in mammals, and their expression is upregulated in various inflammatory diseases and tumors. Ym1/2 (Chi3l3, Chi3l4) are well-known CLPs as markers of alternative activated macrophages and contributors to allergic diseases. A recent study suggests that these CLPs promote γδ T-cell mediated-IL-17 production and neutrophilia in parasite infection. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1), also known as YKL-40 in humans and BRP-39 in mice, is highly expressed in macrophages, epithelial cells, etc. The level of Chi3l1 in the blood has correlations with disease severity in allergic disease, such as asthma, and cancers. Chi3l1 KO mice were studied in Th2 inflammation models by OVA stimulation or IL-13 transgenic, suggesting Chi3l1 is a marker as well as an inducing factor for Th2 inflammation. Recently, Chi3l1 KO mice were also investigated in a study of pulmonary melanoma metastasis. Melanoma challenge induces Chi3l1 expression, and genetic ablation of Chi3l1 in mice leads to reduced pulmonary melanoma metastasis. More recently, it was reported that a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) expressed Chi3l1; secreted Chi3l1 increases tumor progression and M2 macrophage polarization. Collectively, previous studies of Chi3l1 in allergy and cancers suggest that Chi3l1 is a biomarker for inflammatory diseases and cancers that contributes to Th2 inflammation and tumor metastasis. However, its biological roles in adaptive immunity, such as T-cell functions, have been totally unknown.
