 To further explore the function of LINC00941 in GC, LINC00941 co-expression network was constructed by combining LINC00941 with dysregulated coding genes in GC using R package WCGNA. After hierarchical clustering and dynamic tree cutting, LINC00941 co-expression module was identified. The dysregulated coding genes in the module was applied to explore the function of LINC00941 via the functional enrichment analysis. The results of GO terms and KEGG pathways were mainly enriched in cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor metastasis. Our findings indicated that LINC00941 might play an important oncogenic function in GC. LINC00941 located in the 12p11.21 region of the human genome and also known as lncRNA-MUF. In lung adenocarcinoma, survival of patients was negatively associated with high expression of LINC00941 which modulates focal adhesion and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway ( Wang et al., 2018 ). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high expression of LINC00941 significantly promoted EMT and malignant capacity tissues and correlated with poor prognosis ( Yan et al., 2017 ). LINC00941 was differentially expressed in TGF-Î²1-activated A549 cells compared with those in normal controls ( Liu H. et al., 2017 ) and was up-regulated upon treatment of colon cancer cells with chemotherapeutic drugs ( Zinovieva et al., 2018 ). In GC, LINC00941 is up-regulated in tumor tissues ( Luo et al., 2018 ). However, in GC, the precise biological function of LINC00941 have not been characterized.
