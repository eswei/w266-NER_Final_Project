 Although ADMA is emerging as a biomarker of CVD, the implications of elevated circulating SDMA are not well understood. Recent reports, including our group’s, have shown an association between elevated plasma SDMA levels and higher mortality in patients with CVD [ 17 – 19 ]. It has been shown that association of SDMA with CVD risk factors, in particular with hypertension, may arise from compromised renal function [ 17 – 19 ], given that SDMA is eliminated by renal excretion and has been shown to be a marker of estimated glomerular filtration rate [ 22 ]. However, multivariable logistic regression analysis (Table 3), adjusted for glomerular filtration rate and plasma creatinine level, demonstrated that elevated SDMA was associated with hypertension in the RA cohort independent of renal function. SDMA interquartile analysis (Table 4) further demonstrated that patients in the highest SDMA quartile had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia than those in the lowest SDMA quartile. ADMA, ArgMI, and GABR, which have recently emerged as candidate biomarkers of CV risk [ 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 23 ], failed to show significant changes in any of the traditional CVD risk factors analyzed. Our results suggest that SDMA potentially functions as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk factors in RA. More studies are needed to gain an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that link SDMA specifically to hypertension and hyperlipidemia in patients with RA.
