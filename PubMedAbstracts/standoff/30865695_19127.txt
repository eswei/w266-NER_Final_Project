 The present study shows for the first time that NB-UVB treatment significantly suppress elevated S100A8/A9 protein heterocomplex levels in lesional skin to levels comparable to those found in non-lesional skin. These findings are supported by corresponding changes in skin gene expression. Interestingly, our results show that treatment with NB-UVB has no significant effect on serum levels of S100A8/A9. These results suggest that elevated serum S100A8/A9 levels in individuals with psoriasis do not originate from lesional skin keratinocytes as previously suggested by Benoit et al. [ 8 ]. As proposed in earlier studies on S100A8/A9 in healthy middle-aged individuals and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus the origin of serum S100A8/A9 could be circulating neutrophils or thrombocytes. Elevated S100A8/A9 levels in these studies were associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease [ 10 , 27 ] implicating that increased S100A8/A9 serum concentrations could be a marker of systemic inflammation rather than skin inflammation in individuals with psoriasis. Since etanercept treatment induces significant serum S100A8/A9 reduction in patients with psoriasis [ 21 ] S100A8/A9 might be involved in the systemic anti-inflammatory effect of biologics. The expression of S100A15 (Koebnerisin) and S100A7 (Psoriasin) are increased in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with psoriasis [ 28 ]. If S100A8 and S100A9 share similar expression patterns then it is possible that PBMCs could be a source of elevated S100A8/A9 in serum.
