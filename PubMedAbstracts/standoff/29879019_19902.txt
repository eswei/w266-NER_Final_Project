 The induced sputum method is noninvasive and not limited to disease, but the operating procedures are quite stringent and complicated, since the results could be susceptible to interference.[ ²² ] In the recent years, FeNO, as a noninvasive marker of airway inflammation, has been attracted wide attention. FeNO is more convenient, rapid, reproducible, and less painful than induced sputum analysis. The NO detected in exhaled air is produced by nitric oxide synthase catalyzing L-arginine in the airway epithelium. A variety of airway inflammations can lead to elevated NO; however, they are mostly dominated by eosinophilic inflammations.[ ²³ ] In this study, after using multivariate logsitic regression, there was still difference in FeNO between the 2 groups after correcting duration of disease, FEV₁, LAMA, and smoking index: the levels of FeNO in patients with ACOS were significantly higher than those in patients with Non-ACOS, with a FeNO median in the ACOS group twice as high as that of the Non-ACOS group; FeNO was positively correlated with eosinophils in induced sputum. This result is consistent with the results of Seiichi[ ²⁴ ]; Mi-jung[ ²⁵ ] made a ROC analysis on the value of FeNO in the diagnosis of non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB), it was found that select the patients that cut point for >31.7 ppb had diagnostic value for NAEB. These results indicated that FeNO could reflect the levels of eosinophilic airway inflammation. Therefore, FeNO can be used as an indicator for evaluating airway inflammation in ACOS. Our results using ROC curve analysis showed that FeNO could be used for the diagnostic value of ACOS, the optimal cut off point was 25.50 ppb, and it had higher sensitivity and specificity. Chen et al[ ²⁶ ] found that when the cutoff point was 21.5 ppb, the sensitivity was 70% and the specificity was up to 75%, which is similar to the results of this study.
