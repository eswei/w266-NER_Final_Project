 AMPK is a key energy sensor that not only maintains the balance of energy consumption and expenditure but also modulates cell protection against stresses and cell proliferation ⁴¹ , ⁴² . Thus, AMPK activity should be increased in ovarian cancer cells under the hypoxic ascites microenvironment because of pathogenic stresses and low oxygen content. However, it is well known that sustained high AMPK activity may inhibit mTOR signaling in tumor growth ⁴³ . In fact, as cancer cells prefer low AMPK for tumor development and metastasis, low AMPK levels commonly occur in advanced cancer cells because genetic/epigenetic progression enhances cell tolerance to stress and increases cell growth and aggressiveness ⁴⁴ , ⁴⁵ . Our study showed that ovarian cancer cells initially displayed high AMPK activity because of the change in the culture conditions from DMEM to a fatty acid-enriched medium. The high AMPK activity could protect cells against stresses from different media; however, importantly, switching to lipogenesis and lipolysis could have also had a protective effect on ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that there is an inverse relationship between ATP production and AMPK activity in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that there is a negative feedback loop to suppress AMPK activity after prolonged culture in OCM ⁴³ . As a result, the combination of high ATP and low AMPK activity synergistically enhances ovarian cancer aggressiveness in OCM. Previous investigations have noted that low AMPK activity favors tumor progression and invasion ⁴⁶ , ⁴⁷ . Consistently, our findings using knockdown of AMPKα in ovarian cancer cells confirmed that low AMPK activity is required for ex vivo and in vivo tumor growth.
