 More than 30 genetic alterations in the PLOD1 gene have been found to cause Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues [ 31 , 32 ]. Elevated collagen deposition and cross-linking are also known to contribute to the aggressive behavior of cancer by enhancing invasion, migration, and proliferation, thereby contributing to poor prognosis [ 33 – 35 ]. Significantly increased expression of PLODs has been documented in many carcinomas. For example, the high expression of PLOD1 and PLOD2 observed in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma is negatively associated with expression of tumor suppressor gene [ 30 ]. Gjaltema et al. found that PLOD2 expression was significantly upregulated in breast cancer compared with adjacent normal mammary tissue, and the expression level correlated with poorer PFS [ 36 ]. Consistent with this, knockdown of PLOD2 expression in a breast cancer cell line reduced collagen deposition in the primary tumor and reduced tumor growth in a mouse model [ 11 ]. In hepatocellular carcinoma, PLOD2 expression correlated with aggressive progression [ 37 ]; moreover, PLOD3 was found to be highly expressed in this cancer and may be a promising diagnostic biomarker [ 29 , 38 ]. In addition, the incidence and growth of hepatocellular cancer was decreased in PLOD2-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice [ 29 ]. PLOD2 and PLOD3 were among 54 glycoproteins found to be upregulated in colorectal cancer compared with normal tissue [ 39 ]. PLOD2 and another collagen cross-linking enzyme, lysyl oxidase homolog-2, were shown to be epigenetically regulated by the tumor-suppressive microRNAs miR-26a and miR-26b and to promote metastasis in RCC [ 40 ]. The latter observation may shed light on the potential association between kidney fibrosis and tumorigenesis [ 41 ].
