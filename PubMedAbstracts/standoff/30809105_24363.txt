 3.3. Expression of Cytokines and Chemokines Stimulated by Resistin in OA The proinflammatory properties of resistin have been observed in animal models and human tissue samples [ 20 , 43 , 47 , 61 ]. Numerous cytokines and chemokines are upregulated by resistin, making it a novel and interesting therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA and OA. Thus far, the proinflammatory properties of resistin have been studied in human knee fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA patients, human monocytes/macrophages, and human knee articular chondrocytes. In human knee fibroblast-like synoviocytes harvested from RA patients and incubated with resistin in vitro, the expression levels of 18 molecules were more than 2-fold higher in resistin-stimulated cells than in unstimulated cells. These upregulated molecules included the seven chemokines, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, and CCL2, as well as IL-6 [ 70 ]. Consistent with the results in fibroblast-like synoviocytes, another study showed that treatment of human primary monocytes with recombinant human resistin (10 μg/mL) for 48 h led to the release of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1Rα, IL-6, IL-7, CCL4/macrophage inflammatory protein- (MIP-) 1α, CCL3/MIP-1β, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-10, CCL2/methyl-accepted chemotaxis protein- (MCP-) 1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and TNF-α [ 43 ]. Other researchers have found that resistin leads to the upregulation of the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β via the PKA and NF-κB signaling pathways [ 67 ]. OA is characterized by cartilage degeneration, soft tissue damage, and inflammation. In OA, chondrocytes are ultimately damaged by proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and other molecules. Compared to knee chondrocytes from healthy controls, those from OA patients exhibited a greater than 10-fold increase in the expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, CCL3, CCL3L1, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8 (IL-8), MMP-1, and MMP-13 and a less than 10-fold increase in the expression of TNFα, CCL2, CX3CL1, and ADAMTS-4 in response to resistin treatment [ 60 ]. These above results further support the notion that resistin plays a proinflammatory role in cell metabolism, and the cytokines/chemokines triggered by resistin play a larger role in promoting catabolism than anabolism in OA.
