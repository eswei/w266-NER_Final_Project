 Discussion Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality among women worldwide ( 1 , 2 ). Despite advances in breast cancer chemotherapy ( 7 ), the development of chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle in successful breast cancer treatment ( 8 ). Gemcitabine is a widely used chemotherapy drug that serves an important role in the treatment of advanced breast cancer ( 6 ). However, its therapeutic use in cancer chemotherapy is impeded, at least in part, by drug resistance ( 25 ). Over the past decade, increasing research efforts focused on exploring the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance. Recently, various studies have suggested that miRNAs serve an important role in chemotherapy resistance ( 26 , 27 ). miRNAs are tumor suppressors or oncogenes and are able to modulate cancer progression, including cell proliferation and apoptosis ( 16 , 28 ). Certain miRNAs, including let-7, miR-122, miR-152 and miR-1246, have been reported to modulate liver cancer stem cells by directly or indirectly binding to specific target genes that are involved in signal pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, TGF-β signaling, JAK/STAT signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway ( 27 ). Yu et al ( 29 ) reported that miR-200a was overexpressed in gemcitabine-resistant breast cancer cells and that miR-200a inhibition restored sensitivity. In this study, miR-200a promoted DNA damage resistance by inhibiting DNA damage-induced apoptosis via Yes associated protein 1 and tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 1. Previous studies revealed that miR-205-5p is one of the most researched miRNAs in breast cancer and it regulates cell proliferation and invasion ( 21 , 30 ). Li and Li ( 31 ) reported that miR-205-5p inhibited cell migration and invasion in prostate carcinoma by targeting zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) 1. Previous studies further reported that compared with differentiated tumor cells, patient-derived breast cancer stem cells expressed higher levels of miR-205-5p ( 22 ). miR-205-5p upregulation controls cancer stem cell phenotype by targeting erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, tumor protein p63 and epidermal growth factor receptor contributing to targeted therapy resistance ( 24 ). miR-205 accumulation confers gemcitabine sensitivity and in gemcitabine-resistant cancer stem cells it targets and suppresses ZEB1/2, E2F transcriptional factor 1, erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor A ( 32 ). However, the effects of miR-205-5p on gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells remain to be elucidated. In the current study, using cell viability assays, miR-205-5p overexpression in combination with gemcitabine treatment at varying concentration was used to investigate gemcitabine-sensitivity of breast cancer cells. miR-205-5p overexpression increased gemcitabine sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Additionally, miR-205-5p was downregulated in the established MDA-MB-231/GEM cells and induced miR-205-5p overexpression reversed gemcitabine resistance of MDA-MB-231/GEM cells. Furthermore, in the present study, miR-205-5p overexpression increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231/GEM cells following treatment with 40 nM gemcitabine. The results revealed the role of miR-205-5p in breast cancer gemcitabine resistance.
