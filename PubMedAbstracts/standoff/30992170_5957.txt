 2.2 Protein immunoprecipitation (IPP) IPP using [³⁵S]-methionine labelled K562 cell extract was completed as described previously [ 11 , 12 ] to detect autoantibodies against 23 known autoantigens listed in Table 2. Autoantibodies to Ro52 (TRIM-21), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and cytosolic 5’-nucleotidase 1A could not reliably be detected by this method and were therefore omitted from the analysis.

Other includes U3RNP: small nuclear RNA U3 subunit, RNA Pol: RNA polymerase I/II/III, M2 mitochondrial antigen and topoisomerase I. Only three patients (0.18%) had more than one MSA (anti-Jo-1 coexistent with anti-OJ, anti-KS coexistent with anti-TIF1 and anti-KS coexistent with anti-SAE). Anti-PmScl is the only MAA that is not detected at all with a MSA.
