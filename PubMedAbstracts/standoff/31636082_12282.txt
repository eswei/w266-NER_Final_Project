 The majority of repurposing candidates are ‘generally recognized as safe’ plant-derived polyphenols or phytochemicals, specifically a structurally related group of antidiabetic and antioxidant dietary flavonoids. These flavonoids (e.g. fisetin, ellagic acid) appear to share a common target and mechanism of action with a cinnamic acid derivative that can specifically rescue a F119L yeast model of PMM2-CDG ( Lao et al., 2019 ), namely aldose reductase inhibition. Based on structure–activity relationships, we found that epalrestat, a generic diabetic peripheral neuropathy drug and the only safe aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) approved for use in humans ( Hotta et al., 2006 ), is a first-in-class PMM2 enzyme activator. The efficacy of epalrestat in the four genotypically distinct PMM2-CDG fibroblasts tested in this study suggests that epalrestat could be given to PMM2-CDG patients who are compound heterozygous for R141H and any pathogenic variant. However, epalrestat treatment of PMM2-CDG fibroblasts did not increase PMM2 protein levels as measured by immunoblotting, suggesting that aldose reductase inhibition acts post-translationally to boost PMM2 enzyme activity. We propose that aldose reductase inhibition leads to an increase in glucose-1,6-bisphosphate levels as a result of glucose being shunted away from the polyol pathway toward production of phosphorylated glucose. Evidence from epalrestat-treated pmm-2 mutant worms suggests there may also be a minor role for NRF2 as an indirect transcriptional activator of PMM2, which is consistent with a role for NRF2 activation in rescuing hypoglycosylation stress phenotypes in pmm2 mutant zebrafish ( Mukaigasa et al., 2018 ).
