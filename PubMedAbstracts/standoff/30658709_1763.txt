 Background Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), first described in 1969, is a group of genetic autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by fluctuating jaundice, persistent cholestasis, pruritus and malabsorption [ 1 , 2 ]. PFIC predominantly affects young children and results in early-onset progressive liver damage [ 2 ]. Persistent or repetitive cholestasis leads rapidly to end stage liver disease in untreated individuals with PFIC [ 2 ]. Several different genetic aetiologies have been linked to PFIC in last decades. PFIC 1 is caused by mutations in ATPase class I type 8B member 1 (ATP8B1) gene, which encodes the aminophospholipid flippase familial intrahepatic cholestasis-1 protein (FIC1) [ 3 ]. The mutant gene responsible for PFIC 2 is the ATP binding cassette family B member 11 (ABCB11) encoding the bile salt excretion protein (BSEP) [ 4 ]. Mutations in adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4), which encodes the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein 3 protein (MDR3) leads to the development of PFIC 3 [ 5 ]. Genetic mutations in tight junction protein 2 (TJP2) are linked to PFIC 4 with low or normal levels gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and most of reported cases were homozygous mutations [ 6 ]. In addition, mutations in nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (NR1H4), which encodes the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), were recently identified as responsible for a new type of PFIC [ 7 ]. However, known genes mutations still cannot account for all PFIC cases. Genetic profiling of children with cryptogenic cholestasis should be considered in clinical practice. Here, we report a young PFIC child with novel compound heterozygous mutations of TJP2 in China. The clinical features and genetic variants of the patient are described in the study.
