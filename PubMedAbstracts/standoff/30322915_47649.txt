 ENU-Induced Mutations That Likely Cooperate with U2af1(S34F) and Runx1 Deletion in Leukemogenesis. Exome sequencing of leukemic cells from the three cases of AML derived from our mouse model identified at least four somatic mutations that are likely to have contributed functionally to leukemogenesis (Fig. 5):i) The Tet2 variant in AML case 1 affects a splice donor site of a constitutive exon (exon 9, as shown in Fig. 5B) so that exon 9 is skipped during splicing (Fig. 5C). Loss of exon 9 (138 bp in length) does not change the reading frame in the Tet2 coding sequence, but loss of the 2-oxoglutarate-Fe(II)â€“dependent dioxygenase domain, partly encoded by exon 9, likely eliminates normal Tet2 function. ii) The murine Gata2 variant in case 1 AML is equivalent to GATA2(R362Q) (Fig. 5E), which is one of the recurrent GATA2 mutations in AML [Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) ID: COSM87004] (refs. 51 and 52 ). GATA2 encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role during hematopoiesis. iii) The Idh1 mutation identified in one of the late AML cases (case 2) is equivalent to human IDH1(R132Q) (Fig. 5H). R132 mutants of IDH1, including IDH1(R132Q), produce the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (Fig. 5J) that is commonly elevated in several human cancers including AML ( 53 ). iv) The variant allele Ikzf1(C175R), found in one case of late AML (case 3), affects a conserved cysteine in a zinc finger domain of the transcription factor it encodes (Fig. 5L) and thus likely compromises (or alters) the DNA-binding capacity of Ikzf1. IKZF1, a known tumor-suppressor gene for lymphoid neoplasms ( 54 ), is also recurrently deleted in MPN ( 55 ) and pediatric AML ( 56 ). In combination with our results, it seems likely that IKZF1 is a tumor-suppressor gene for myeloid cancers as well. These likely driver mutations from the three AML cases in our mice occurred largely independently, but some appear to be functionally related, implying that they may affect hematopoietic cell functions that must be altered to produce murine AML. For example, mutant IDH1 is known to inhibit TET2 enzyme activity ( 57 ), and Gata2 and Ikzf1 (as well as Runx1) are transcription factors critical for hematopoietic lineage specification and/or HSC function. Mutant U2AF1 might cooperate with alterations of the epigenetic modifiers and lineage transcription factors to initiate leukemogenesis.
