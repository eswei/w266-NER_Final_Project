 miR-125b and AD The serum miR-125b was down-regulated in AD patients compared with that of control subjects [ 15 , 53 - 55 ]. In addition, decreased circulating miR-125b was also found in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse models of AD [ 24 ]. In the Aβ pathological condition, the reduced expression of miR-125b is a critical event for the neurotoxic effect in cortical neurons. 17β-estradiol can protect neurons from the Aβ-peptide caused neurotoxicity via up-regulation miR-125b expression [ 56 ]. However, it is inconsistently with the protection role of miR-125b in AD. MiR-125b was found highly expression in AD patients [ 57 ]. Up-regulation of miR-125b caused tau hyperphosphorylation, inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, induced inflammation and oxidative stress by activation of CDK5 and p35/25, p44/42-MAPK signaling pathway, and suppressed expressions of forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W, and sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) [ 57 - 59 ]. It is probably that the aberrant expression of miR-125b contributes to the neural dysfunction in AD brain.
