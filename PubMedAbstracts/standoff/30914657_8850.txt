 Given the role of LPA as a strong pro-inflammatory mediator, its homeostasis is tightly regulated through both biosynthesis and degradation (Fig. 2a). We therefore compared the ACP6 expression in benign and malignant ovarian tissues. ACP6 was highly expressed in normal fallopian tube epithelial tissues compared to normal ovaries and ovarian cancer (Figs 2b,c and S2a). To understand if the R273H p53 mutation regulates LPA levels via modifying the expression of ATX, ACP6 or other LPA phosphatases, we examined their transcript levels in wild-type and mutant p53 FTEC. ACP6 RNA and protein expression was significantly reduced in mutant p53 cells, while ATX expression was not affected by R273H p53 (Figs 2d and S2b–d). Other LPA phosphatases, such as LPP1, LPP2 and LPP3, were also not affected by p53 status (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Immunofluorescence staining for ACP6 and p53 found decreased expression of ACP6 in the p53 mutant tumor compartment, while normal fallopian tube epithelial cells demonstrated high expression of ACP6 (Fig. 2e). To investigate if mutant p53 attenuates ACP6 expression in patients with serous OvCa harboring R273H and R248Q mutations, we queried the University of Chicago OvCa tissue bank ³¹ to identify patients with HGSOC harboring these specific p53 mutations as assessed by molecular testing. We found significantly decreased expression of ACP6 in p53 mutant tumor compartments of these patients and high ACP6 levels in adjacent normal fallopian tube epithelia (Figs 2f and S2f,g). Figure 2 Mutant p53 regulates LPA signaling through ACP6. (a) Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is produced by autotaxin (ATX) from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase type 6 (ACP6) hydrolyzes LPA to monoacylglycerol (MAG) and inorganic phosphate (Pᵢ). (b) Representative ACP6 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on patient tissues (n = 7, scale bars: 20 and 100 µm) (c) qRT-PCR of ACP6 in patient samples: ovarian tumors (OvTu; n = 18 patients) and normal fallopian tube tissues (nFT; n = 12 patients). (d) ACP6 protein expression in wild-type (wt) p53 and R273H p53 mutant FTEC. (e) Representative immunofluorescence (IF) of ACP6 (red) and p53 (pantropic antibody; green) in tumor and adjacent fallopian tube tissue. (f) Immunofluorescence of an HGSOC harboring a R248Q p53 mutation. Analysis of ACP6 (red) and p53 (green). (g) ACP6 promoter activity in wild-type (wt) p53 FTEC and R175H, R249S and R273H p53 mutant FTEC as assessed by dual luciferase assay (n = 3, two-way analysis of variance). For (a–g): ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Error bars are SEM.
