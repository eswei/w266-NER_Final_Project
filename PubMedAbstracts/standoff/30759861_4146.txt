 Yet, Sly-KD mice phenotype is milder than that of mice with a 9/10th or complete deletion of NPYq. This could be due to insufficient Sly knockdown in Sly-KD, involvement of another NPYq gene in the phenotype of mice with NPYq deficiency, or both. To address this question and to further elucidate the role of Sly in the infertile phenotype of mice with NPYq deletions, we undertook a two-pronged approach. First, if sperm abnormalities in NPYq-deficient mice are a consequence of Sly deficiency, then there should be a correlation between the extent of Sly reduction and the severity of sperm defects. We showed earlier that Sly transcript levels correlated well with the phenotype [ 16 ]. However, the analysis of SLY protein expression was hampered by the fact that the only available SLY antibody only detects the SLY protein long isoform, SLY1, and not the shorter SLY2. To overcome this problem, we developed a new anti-SLY1/2 antibody and used it to characterize SLY expression in NPYq- and Sly-deficient mice. Second, if sperm abnormalities in NPYq-deficient mice are a consequence of Sly deficiency, then transgenically bringing Sly/SLY expression in NPY deficient mice to normal levels, should rescue their infertile phenotype. To address this, we developed mice transgenic for Sly and placed the Sly transgene in the context of sub- and infertile NPYq-deficient genotypes.
