 Elevated circulating chemerin in CRC patients was described in recent studies [ 7 , 9 ]. In patients with adenomas serum chemerin was nearly 50% higher than in healthy controls [ 14 ]. Chemerin concentration of CRC patients was about 15% increased in one CRC cohort whereas the second analysis reported a more than four-fold induction compared to healthy controls [ 7 , 9 ]. In the present study groups, chemerin serum levels did not differ between CRC patients with liver metastases and patients without tumors. This suggests that chemerin is not solely raised in CRC patients but is high in patients suffering from different diseases. Indeed, higher chemerin was described in psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary artery stenosis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ]. Therefore, high chemerin may be related to inflammatory processes rather than being a specific marker of CRC. Moreover, chemerin expression was reduced in colon adenomas [ 13 ] and may be low in CRC. Therefore, it is unlikely that increased serum chemerin levels do result from the tumor tissue [ 37 ]. Serum chemerin comes from adipose tissues and the relationship between fat depots and CRC in tumor patients warrants further investigation.
