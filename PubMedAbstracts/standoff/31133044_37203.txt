 Previous studies have focused mainly on the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in cancer cells. However, p-ERK1/2 expression has been shown prognostic and metastatic implications in PDAC [ 40 , 41 ]. Our result showed HMPDAC cells had high levels of activated ERK1/2, whereas inhibiting ERK1/2 suppressed EMT in these cells. Furthermore, activation of ERK1/2 also increased in PDAC cells after co-culture with PSCs. These findings indicate that activation of ERK1/2 promotes metastasis and cancerâ€“stromal interaction in PDAC cells. We found that activation of ERK1/2 was frequently observed in stroma even compared with PCCs in the resected pancreatic cancer tissues. Moreover, cancer-associated PSCs were more sensitive to ERK inhibitor SCH772984 than cancer cells. Therefore, the present research focused on the activation of ERK1/2 in PSCs as well as PCCs. Cancer-associated PSCs are the major components of extensive desmoplasia, which contribute to PDAC progression and chemoresistance [ 42 ]. Recently, anti-stromal drugs were reported to inhibit PDAC progression via suppression of PSCs [ 43 , 44 ]. These findings suggest that inhibiting PSCs could be the basis of an effective therapeutic strategy for PDAC.
