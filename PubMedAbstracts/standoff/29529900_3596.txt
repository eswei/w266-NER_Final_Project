 There are many polymorphic regions in VDR, among which Fok1, Bsm1, Apa1, and Taq1 are the most extensively studied in American (Hispanic white, nonhispanic white, and Caucasian) and Asians (Iranian and Egyptian) populations. ¹⁹ – ²⁴ Attention focuses on the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VDR that are associated with the development of a wide range of pathological conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, and BC ¹⁸ – ²⁰ . However, limited studies are available on the Pakistani population. ²⁵ Studies of Jordanian populations reveal a statistically significant difference between VDR Taq1 variants and 25(OH)D among women with BC. ²¹ Bsm1 and Cdx2 polymorphisms are significantly associated with women with BC living in Southeastern Iran. ²⁰ The Fok1 SNP in BC plays a protective role, whereas the Bsm1 SNP is not associated with BC among women living in the Iranian city of Urmia. ²² Among Egyptian women, the Bsm1 “B” allele and “Bb” variants of VDR may represent a risk factor for susceptibility to the development of BC. ²³ In contrast, a meta-analysis shows no association of VDR SNPs (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, and Apa1) with risk of BC in a general population or in a Caucasian population. ²⁴ Among Pakistanis who are BRCA1/2 non-carriers, the Bsm1 “b” allele is associated with an increased risk of BC”. ²⁵ Although the associations of VDR Fok1 and Bsm1 SNPs with the risk of BC have been investigated, no study, to our knowledge, investigated the relationship between the VDR Tru9I polymorphism and the premenopausal risk of BC. Therefore, the present study was designed detect an association between the novel low penetrance VDR Tru9I SNP and BC among premenopausal women of Pakistan.
