 The underlying mechanism by how HOXA11‐AS involved in HCC tumorigenesis still remains to be researched. Growing studies indicated that lncRNAs acted crucial roles in several biological processes by playing as ceRNAs (competing endogenous RNAs) or molecular sponges to modulate‐specific miRNAs.34, 37, 41, 42, 43 Previous study showed that HOXA11‐AS functions as an oncogenic gene which enhanced glioma cell metastasis and growth by inhibiting miR‐214‐3p/EZH2 expression.39 In this regard, we also found that ectopic expression of HOXA11‐AS suppressing the miR‐214‐3p expression in the HCC cell. miR‐214 was demonstrated to be one tumour suppressor miRNA in a lot of tumours including HCC.44, 45, 46, 47 Yang et al48 indicated that miR‐214 inhibited the HCC cell proliferation through targeting E2F3 expression. Wang et al49 also confirmed that the expression of miR‐214 was down‐regulated in HCC specimens and cells and overexpression of miR‐214 suppressed HCC cell proliferation by regulating β‐catenin expression. In addition, Li et al50 showed that the expression of miR‐214‐3p was down‐regulated in HCC tissues and miR‐214‐3p overexpression decreased HCC cell cycle, cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis partly by regulating embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) expression. Therefore, we focused on the miR‐214‐3p as a ceRNA of HOXA11‐AS. We demonstrated that miR‐214‐3p expression was down‐regulated in the HCC tissues and the expression of miR‐214‐3p was negatively correlated with the expression of HOXA11‐AS. HOXA11‐AS overexpression promoted HCC proliferation and invasion and induced EMT through inhibiting miR‐214‐3p expression. These results suggested that lncRNA HOXA11‐AS played an oncogene role in HCC through acting as ceRNA for miR‐214‐3p.
