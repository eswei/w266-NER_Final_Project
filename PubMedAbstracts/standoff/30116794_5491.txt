 McCoy et al first described the association between Fusobacterium and colorectal adenoma ⁴ ⁾. They compared the abundance of Fusobacterium in normal rectal mucosa isolated from subjects with adenoma (48 cases) and from subjects without adenoma (67 cases) and found that rectal mucosa from adenoma patients were significantly enriched in Fusobacterium compared with mucosa from subjects without adenoma ⁴ ⁾. In contrast to McCoy's study, Kostic et al directly quantified Fusobacterium spp. loads in adenomas and matched adjacent normal tissues from the same patient. They found significant enrichment of the Fusobacterium species in adenoma tissues (P < 0.004) ⁵ ⁾. Flanagan et al quantified Fn loads in 52 colorectal adenomas and nearby normal mucosa and found that there was a trend but no significant association between the Fn level and adenoma state. However, they found a significantly higher Fn load in high-grade dysplasia and in CRC, thus suggesting that the Fn level was associated with progression of adenoma to carcinoma ¹⁶ ⁾. Although a higher level of Fn load was detected in adenoma and carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, carcinoma tissues contained more Fn than adenoma tissues ¹⁶ ⁾. Similarly, Yu et al observed a gradual increase in the Fn load during the transition from adenoma to carcinoma ¹⁸ ⁾. Taken together, these results suggest that Fn infection may be involved in progression from adenoma to carcinoma in some CRC cases.
