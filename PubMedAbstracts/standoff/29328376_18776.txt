 The phenotype of 21-OHD is associated with its genotype, including point mutations, frame shift mutations and deletion mutations of small DNA fragments. SW-, SV- or NC-type 21-OHD maybe predicted by clinical gene sequencing. Concolino et al ( 24 ) demonstrated that the consensus between genotype and SW CAH patients was 81.8%. Baumgartner-Parzer et al ( 25 ) reported that the consistency between genotype and clinical phenotype was 80%. However, genotype and clinical phenotype are not always completely consistent, and the same 21-OHD gene mutation in patients with CAH may result in different clinical phenotypes ( 26 , 27 ). New et al ( 28 ) reported that certain mutations, including the P30L, I2Gand I172N mutations, were prone to yield different CAH phenotypes. In SW and NC CAH, a phenotype maybe attributed to a genotype. However, in SV CAH, wide phenotypic variability may be observed, particularly with the exon 4 I172N mutation ( 28 ). Janjanin et al ( 29 ) described five patients with 21-OHD belonging to three generations of the same family (grandmother, parents and two children), whose genotype corresponded to NC CAH. Notably, in spite of one minorCYP21 mutation, the proband presented with the SV form of 21-OHD and required glucocorticoid replacement therapy from the age of 4 years. In the present study, the CYP21A2 gene sequencing of the patient, in addition to the clinical symptoms and gene sequencing results, revealed c.1024C>T (p. Arg342Trp) and heterozygous deletion mutations, which supported the clinical diagnosis of SV CAH.
