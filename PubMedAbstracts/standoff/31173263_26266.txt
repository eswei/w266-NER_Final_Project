 Previously, it was shown that deregulation of Bmi1 is associated with the pathogenesis of different human cancer types, including breast cancer ( 19 , 20 ), Ewing sarcoma ( 21 ) and leukemia ( 22 , 23 ). Furthermore, Bmi1 was shown to be a useful molecular marker to predict the prognosis of bladder cancer ( 24 ) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( 25 , 26 ). The significantly high frequency of Bmi1 expression in invasive SCC compared with that in HSIL and NC samples is a finding of great interest. First, Bmi1 staining in the normal cervical epithelium was found only in basal cells where epithelial ‘reserve’ cells are located. It has been suggested that reserve cells appear to be the candidate for cervical stem cells ( 27 ), and they play a central role in the pathogenesis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Because Bmi1 is necessary to maintain normal stem cells and cancer stem cells ( 28 ), the present experiments indicated that Bmi1 expression is more upregulated in HSILs and invasive cervical cancer than in normal cancer. At the same time, squamous carcinoma stage II and III showed a relatively higher intensity of Bmi1 staining than squamous carcinoma stage I. These results were consistent with those of the previous study. Furthermore, exogenously expressed Bmi1 enhanced tumorigenicity, and knockdown of Bmi1 suppressed tumorigenicity, indicating that KLF4 works as a promoter for cervical cancer. These results support the notion that highly expressed Bmi1 promotes the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma.
