 Conclusions Overexpression or dysregulation of RTKs in breast cancer cells leads to accelerated tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis through the activation of various downstream signaling pathways. RTKs play a key role in cancer stemness and drug resistance to various conventional anti-cancer therapies. Hence, targeting RTKs is one of the more promising approaches for the management of breast cancer. Many of RTK targeting drugs are in clinic for the treatment of breast cancer. However, resistance-driven by mutations in RTKs and alternate pathway activation limits the use of anti-RTK therapeutics for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The comprehensive mechanism underlying the resistance to anti-RTK therapy needs to be investigated to develop therapeutic regimens for successful treatment of anti-RTK therapy-resistant breast cancer.
