 In the apolipoprotein E-/- mouse model, TRAIL deficiency has been shown to aggravate renal disease and insulin resistance. ²³ Two case-control studies conducted in Turkey and China further demonstrated that levels of sTRAIL were higher in healthy individuals than in individuals newly diagnosed with T2DM. ²⁴ – ²⁵ The latter results are consistent with our study. ²⁴ – ²⁵ In another study that was conducted in Turkey, levels of sTRAIL were found to be significantly lower in patients with DN with foot ulcers compared to healthy subjects. ¹⁵ In animal studies, an injection of SDR5 to block TRAIL accelerated autoimmune diabetes. ²⁶ Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that TRAIL may play a protective role in DN and DM. The present case-control study compared serum levels of sTRAIL and TRAIL mRNA expression in patients with DN, T2DM and control subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an association between TRAIL mRNA levels in PBMCs that were collected from DN and T2DM patients. The levels of TRAIL mRNA in PBMCs and sTRAIL in sera were both significantly lower in the DN and T2DM patients compared to the CNT group, but some research results are not consistent with our results. For example, expression of TRAIL was found to be significantly higher in the kidneys of diabetic patients than in the kidneys of healthy individuals. ¹⁴ Another study reported that patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria had significantly higher serum levels of TRAIL than individuals with normal albuminuria. ²⁷ These ﬁndings suggest that TRAIL has the capacity to mediate both destructive and anti-inﬂammatory properties in DM and DN.
