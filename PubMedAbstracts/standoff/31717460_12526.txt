 3. Discussion DOCK1 is highly expressed in malignant breast cancer cells, especially in TNBC [ 25 ]. Our data showed that DOCK1 depletion induced claudin-1 re-expression, and a negative correlation between DOCK1 and claudin-1 has been observed in clinical TNBC patients, which indicates that claudin-1 might be negatively regulated by DOCK1. Claudin-1 knockdown ameliorated DOCK1-mediated cell growth inhibition and migration, which demonstrates that DOCK1-regulated claudin-1 plays an important role in CLBC growth. It may also explain the high aggressiveness of CLBC results from high DOCK1 expression. The DOCK1 depletion-induced increase in claudin-1 inhibited cell migration and induced caspase activation and cell death, which is consistent with the previous finding that re-expression of claudin-1 causes cell apoptosis in TNBC [ 15 , 16 ] and modulates the mobility of melanoma cells [ 26 ]. However, apoptosis regulation-relevant molecules modulated by claudin-1 in CLBC require further investigation. In lung adenocarcinoma, claudin-1 re-expression-modulated cell growth is associated with up-regulation of cancer invasion/metastasis suppressors (e.g., connective tissue growth factor, thrombospondin 1, deleted in liver cancer 1, occludin, and ZO-1) and down-regulation of invasion/metastasis enhancers (e.g., secreted phosphoprotein 1, cut-like homeobox 1, transforming growth factor alpha, solute carrier family 2 member 3, and placental growth factor) [ 27 ]. Other members of the claudin family have also been reported to function as tumor suppressors. Overexpression of claudin-4 significantly reduces the invasive potential and clonogenic activity, as well as pulmonary metastasis, in human pancreatic cancer cells [ 28 ], breast cancer cells [ 29 ], and clear cell renal cell carcinoma [ 30 ]. Genes other than CLDN1, CLDN3, CLDN4, CLDN7, and ZO1 may also be coordinately regulated by DOCK1 and may contribute to tumor growth, but this remains to be investigated.
