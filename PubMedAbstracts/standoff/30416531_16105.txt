 Although APAP is a safe drug at a normal therapeutic dose, the possibility of hepatotoxicity still persists. APAP-induced liver injury is one of the best characterized systems of xenobiotic-induced liver injury for evaluating new treatment approaches [ 14 ]. After a therapeutic dose, APAP is mainly metabolized and changed into pharmacologically inactive glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, whereas a minor fraction is oxidized into a toxin that binds to the sulfhydryl group of glutathione (GSH) to form an APAPâ€“GSH conjugate that is then excreted in the urine [ 15 ]. Excessive N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine formation depletes cellular GSH levels, leading to subsequent ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation and liver injury [ 2 , 16 ]. APAP-mediated liver injury is exacerbated in Nrf2-deficient animals due to reduced expressions of antioxidant genes [ 17 ] and the efflux of APAP metabolites [ 18 ]. However, liver-specific kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-deficient animals were more resistant to APAP-induced liver injury [ 19 ]. In addition, constant Nrf2 activation increased the basal hepatic GSH levels and accelerated their recovery after APAP treatment [ 20 ]. Recent data also support alleviation of APAP-induced liver injury through activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway [ 21 , 22 ]. In the current study, PME induced activation of the Nrf2 pathway and decreased ROS production in vitro. In addition, PME also significantly improved the survival of mice with APAP-induced acute liver injury. Pretreatment with PME ameliorated APAP-induced liver injury, as evidenced by reliving increased plasma ALT and AST activities, and by attenuation of hepatic histological changes. Based on these findings, PME showed potential activities against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by activating Nrf2, upregulating antioxidant defense, and reducing ROS production.
