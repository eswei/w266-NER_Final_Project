 Taken together, the present study indicated that miR-195-5p was significantly upregulated in DVT patients, and that it may be involved in the development of DVT by regulating the apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. It was further identified that Bcl-2 was a direct target of miR-195-5p, and that Bcl-2 was downregulated in the peripheral blood of DVT patients. Thus, it is thought that the downregulation of Bcl-2 in the peripheral blood of DVT patients was associated with the upregulation of miR-195-5p. Moreover, the data of this present study indicated that downregulation of miR-195-5p significantly promoted the cell viability and inhibited the apoptosis of HUVECs. Raised miR-195-5p expression inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in HUVECs, changes that were reversed by raised Bcl-2 expression. These data indicated that miR-195-5p was involved in the development of DVT by regulating the apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, miR-195-5p may be a potential DVT biomarker and therapeutic target. However, this study is only a preliminary study of miR-195-5p in DVT and as such, contains limitations. The sample size of this study was based on previous studies ( 21 – 23 ). A power analysis should be performed for future studies to determine the effective sample volume. Furthermore, a ‘mimic + control plasmid group’ was not set up in this study. Finally, in vivo experiments are also required to further this research.
