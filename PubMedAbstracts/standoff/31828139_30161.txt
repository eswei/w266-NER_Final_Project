 In accordance with previous studies, our untreated CKD rats displayed the marked elevation of serum triglycerides, NEFA, and VLDL levels. Furthermore, hepatic triglycerides and NEFA levels were also significantly higher in CKD rats. This was associated with a significant reduction in lipase enzyme activity and protein expression in the liver (hepatic lipase), heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and serum. Furthermore, the CKD rats in this study showed marked downregulation of VLDL receptor in these tissues. Thus, the results presented in this study substantiate the claim that CKD-induced hypertriglyceridemia could be due, at least in part, to lipase deficiency [ 49 , 50 ]. Long-term atorvastatin administration in the CKD rats results in a significant decline in serum and hepatic triglyceride and NEFA levels, as well as serum VLDL levels. This was accompanied by the upregulation of lipase protein expression and enzyme activity in hepatic and various extrahepatic tissues. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia in CKD rats is associated with impaired maturation of HDL-3 to HDL-2 mediated by LCAT deficiency which further contributes to defective lipolysis and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (i.e. VLDL and chylomicrons) in circulation. Thus, it can be postulated that improvement in hypertriglyceridemia in the atorvastatin-treated CKD rats could be due to the improvement in HDL metabolism. Several clinical trials of statins have shown the beneficial effects on serum LDL, HDL and triglyceride in nonuremic hyperlipidemic population [ 51 ]. Thus, the effects observed in the CKD rats are consistent with those founds in hyperlipidemic population.
