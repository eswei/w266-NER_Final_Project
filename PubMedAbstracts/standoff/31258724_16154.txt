 The role of PSME3 in cancer has been well characterized. PSME3 knockout mice treated with dextran sodium sulfate to induce acute colitis showed decreased intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated cancer compared to wild-type mice. 27 In oral squamous cell carcinoma, high expression of PSME3 was correlated with worse OS, while PSME3 silencing inhibited the growth, proliferation and mobility of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice in vivo . 12 Similarly, PSME3 silencing attenuated the cell proliferation, migration and invasive abilities of endometrial cancer cells. In a model of skin tumorigenesis, PSME3 functioned as an oncogene, whereby the TPA-induced overexpression of PSME3 was dependent on the activation of the MAPK-p38 signaling pathway. 28 In breast cancer, 5-year disease-free survival and OS in patients with undetectable or low PSME3 expression were significantly higher than in patients with high PSME3 expression. 6 In colorectal cancer, PSME3 expression was higher in colorectal cancer tissue than in healthy tissues. 10 Other studies indicate that mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53, occur in various types of cancer, and that PSME3 negatively regulates p53, whereby the elimination of endogenous PSME3 in human cancer cells abrogates MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, increases the activity of p53, and enhances apoptosis. 29 Notably, p53 mutations show a positive correlation with PSME3 expression in various cancer cell lines. 30 In normal endometrium, expression of PSME3 was increased in p53-positive specimens compared to p53-negative specimens, 31 and in laryngeal carcinoma, the expression of PSME3 was correlated with p53 and p21. 11 , 32 - 34
