 Initially, we found that LINC00968 was poorly expressed during breast cancer while WNT2 and β-catenin expression as well as β-catenin and GSK3β phosphorylation were markedly increased. A recent study demonstrated that LINC00968, one of the top 10 aberrantly expressed lncRNAs, was low in lung squamous cell carcinoma expression profile than the adjacent normal lung tissues [ 31 ]. Additionally, another similar work has shown that a lncRNA, i.e. lncRNA-GAS5, was also under-expressed in breast cancer cells [ 32 ]. LncRNA anti-differentiation noncoding RNA was also down-regulated in breast cancer, and enhances transforming growth factor-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis [ 33 ]. On the other hand, relative expression profiles of WNT2 were also documented to be elevated in cervical cancer and its abundance have a significant impact on positive parametrium, lymphovascular space involvement, tumor size and pelvic lymph node metastasis [ 34 ]. Another previous study in line with our current work also demonstrated relatively higher WNT2 expression in breast cancer, which may play an important role for breast cancer development and in turn, its treatment [ 35 ]. Lastly, axin1, phospho-β-catenin and GSK3β complex has been demonstrated to be associated with heat shock protein 90 α/β in the human MCF-7 epithelial breast cancer model [ 36 ].
