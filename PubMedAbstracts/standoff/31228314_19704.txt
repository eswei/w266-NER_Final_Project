 lncRNA KIAA0125 has been studied in different diseases. It exerts a regulatory effect in neurogenesis and may be responsible for Abeta ratio in Alzheimer disease (Uhrig et al., 2009). Some studies have shown that KIAA0125 as a mediator gene correlated with the survival of acute myeloid leukemia (Hornung et al., 2018). In the meanwhile, the expression pattern of KIAA0125 in tumors also seems inconsistent. It is upregulated in ameloblastomas but the function has not been characterized (Diniz et al., 2018). The role of KIAA0125 in gallbladder cancer is not certainly defined because of the original related article was retracted (International BR, 2017). The bioinformatics analysis has shown KIAA0125 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer, but further investigations are required to elucidate the function (Yao et al., 2017). Therefore, the role of KIAA0125 in tumors may be cell‚Äêtype dependent, although this possibility needs to be further investigated. Our results suggest that KIAA0125 may act as an oncosuppressor gene in CRC cells since overexpression of KIAA0125 significantly supressed cell growth and the potentials of invasion and migration whereas the reversal effects were showed in knockdown experiments. We chose HCT116 and SW480 cell lines because of the relative low expression that close to the results we found in tumor tissues. Also, the knockdown experiments indicated the low expressed KIAA0125 still obtained the function in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Thus, the relative low expression in CRC tissues and cells suggested loss of function and KIAA0125 may exist putative roles in balancing the cell microenvironment.
