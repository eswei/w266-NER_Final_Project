 Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of dNTPs, which are essential for DNA replication and DNA damage repair [ 5 ]. RNR consists of two RRM1 subunits and two RRM2 subunits [ 6 ]. The relevance of RRM2 to cancer is underscored by the fact that RRM2 is overexpressed in gastric, ovarian, bladder and colorectal cancers [ 7 â€“ 11 ], and that RRM2 overexpression contributes to gemcitabine resistance in human oral [ 12 ] and pancreatic [ 13 ] cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of RRM2 in breast cancer cells causes resistance to tamoxifen [ 14 ]. Therefore, inhibitors of RRM2, such as hydroxyurea (HU), 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, Triapine) and antisense GTI-2040, are currently used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and head and neck cancer [ 15 , 16 ]. Targeting RRM2 is also a strategy for overcoming gemcitabine resistance [ 17 ]. For example, COH29 (a RRM2 inhibitor currently in a phase I clinical trial) inhibits the growth of cancer cells that are resistant to HU and gemcitabine [ 18 , 19 ]. Another RRM2 inhibitor, GW8510, has been reported to suppress colorectal cancer growth [ 20 ]. Together, these studies demonstrate that RRM2 is an important target for the development of novel anticancer drugs [ 5 ]. RRM2B is one small subunit of RRM2, which is induced by p53 and required for DNA repair and mtDNA synthesis [ 21 , 22 ].
