 In a previous study, miR‐497‐5p was reported as an oncogene in renal cell carcinoma (Li, Chen, et al., 2016). However, the characterization of miR‐497‐5p in HCC and its association with disease progression and development remain unclear. In this study, we found that miR‐497‐5p was downregulated in HCC tumor tissues and HCC cell lines. MiR‐497‐5p downregulation correlated with a larger tumor size (≥5 cm) (p = .003), multiple tumors (p = .018) and positive HBV DNA levels (p = .007) and predicted poor prognosis. Currently, the HBV DNA levels level is closely related to the recurrence of HCC, and it is used to predict the risk of recurrence in HBsAg‐positive HCC patients after hepatectomy. The relationship between the expression of the miR‐497‐5p and the serum AFP levels suggests that miR‐497‐5p may be a potential biomarker for diagnosing HCC. Furthermore, its close relationship with the HBV DNA levels and the degree of tumor size also indicates that miR‐497‐5p may be related to hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of miR‐497‐5p in Huh7 and HepG2 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. These results strongly suggest thatmiR‐497‐5p has an inhibitory role in HCC.
