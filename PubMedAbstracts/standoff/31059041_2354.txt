 Although the pathogenesis remains not clearly defined, accumulating evidence has suggested that AS is highly heritable. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, a class I surface antigen encoded by B locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short (p) arm of chromosome 6, is one of the convincing genetic factors associated with AS ( 3 ). HLA-B27 was reported to be present in 94.3% of patients with AS, but only 9.34% in organ donors ( 4 ). The expression of HLA-B27 was found to be significantly higher in patients with AS than that in healthy subjects ( 5 ). Meta-analyses indicated that HLA-B27 genetic polymorphism B2704 and B2702 may be risk factors, while B2703, B2706, B2707, B2727, B2729 and B2747 may be protective factors for AS ( 6 , 7 ). HLA-B27-positive patients had a significantly younger age at symptom onset, more uveitis, and a higher frequency of peripheral and hip joint involvement than HLA-B27-negative patients ( 7 , 8 ). Thus, HLA-B27 has been the most commonly used biomarker for the diagnosis of AS ( 9 ). However, twin and family studies suggest that HLA-B27 only can explain less than 30% of the overall risk for AS ( 10 , 11 ), meaning there are other genes related with the genetic disorder of AS. Recently, scholars have also aimed to investigate other inflammatory biomarkers for AS, including interleukin (IL)-8 ( 12 ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± ( 13 ), C-reactive protein (hsCRP) ( 14 ) and C-C motif chemokine 11 (CCL11) ( 15 ), but studies that have focused on the genetic biomarkers are limited ( 16 , 17 ).
