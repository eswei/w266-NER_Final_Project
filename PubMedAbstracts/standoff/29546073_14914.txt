 In 2008, Locharernkul et al. first identified that the HLA-B∗15:02 allele was strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS (P = 0.0005) in the Thai population [ 27 ]. A consistent association of the cases of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN were reported among the carriers of the HLA-B∗15:02 allele in this Thai population [ 20 , 28 ]. Our findings justify the strongest association of the HLA-B∗15:02 allele in the prediction of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN. In our study, we observed that the HLA-B∗15:02 allele was not specific for carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN only, but it was also significantly associated with carbamazepine-induced MPE. However, a previous study by Hung et al. reported the phenotype-specific HLA association of carbamazepine-induced cADRs [ 3 ]. This discrepancy might be due to the different study populations. We observed the first evidence of a significant association of the HLA-B∗15:21 allele with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in Thai subjects. HLA-B∗15:21 allele belongs to the HLA-B75 family, which consists of the HLA-B∗15:02 allele as well [ 29 ]. Jaruthamsophon et al. reported that HLA-B∗15:21 was associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS in different populations and that a patient without the HLA-B∗15:02 allele may be at a risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS due to the presence of the HLA-B∗15:21 allele, another HLA-B75 serotype marker [ 21 ]. We can conclude that the presence of alternative forms of HLA alleles belonging to the same subfamilies of serotypes might contribute to the susceptibility to cADRs. These observations imply that members of the HLA-B75 serotype encode proteins sharing a similar conformation for carbamazepine binding and presentation and trigger the immune response of SJS caused by carbamazepine [ 19 ].
