 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between T2DM and fractures. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are accumulated in the bones and contribute to the low bone quality in diabetic patients [ 13 ]. Indeed, serum levels of pentosidine appear to be associated with the risk of fracture in patients with T2DM [ 14 ]. Moreover, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) have an important anabolic effect on bone metabolism. Low levels of IGF1 are associated with increased risk for fractures [ 15 ]. Osteocalcin, which is mainly produced by osteoblasts, is a bone formation marker [ 16 ]. Serum osteocalcin levels in women with T2DM are lower compared with nondiabetic women [ 17 , 18 ]. Moreover, there is an inverse association between serum osteocalcin levels and both fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance [ 19 ]. Incretins have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of increased fracture risk in patients with T2DM. The gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) contributes to the promotion of bone formation and to the reduction of bone absorption and is reduced in patients with T2DM [ 20 ]. Sclerostin, a protein that is expressed in osteocytes, is increased in T2DM and might also play a role in the poor bone quality of these patients [ 21 , 22 ]. More specifically, sclerostin binds to its low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6, which are found in osteoblasts. This leads to the inhibition of the Wnt-β–catenin pathway, which results in inhibition of osteoblastogenesis and bone formation [ 23 ]. Finally, the levels of vitamin D were also shown to be lower in patients with T2DM [ 24 , 25 ].
