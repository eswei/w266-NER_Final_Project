 In this study, the anti-fibrotic action of AICAR was also noted. AICAR significantly decreased hepatic hydroxyproline content and improved the pathological change of BDL rats. The expression of TGF-β, α-SMA, TIMP, and CTGF (the indicators of hepatic fibrosis) was decreased in the chronic AICAR-treated BDL rats. Previous studies have shown that ACIAR alleviated carbon tetrachloride-induced acute hepatitis in mice [ 37 ]. This may add an alternative explanation regaiding how AICAR reduces portal pressure in our BDL rats. One reason is increased intrahepatic NO production, and another reason could be decreased liver fibrosis and improved liver structure. It is also not clear, in terms of the mechanism, how AICAR ameliorate liver fibrosis. Chen et al. once reported that melatonin could protect the liver from BDL-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress via the AMPK-SIRT3-SOD2 pathway [ 49 ]. Yang et al. found that ursolic acid offers protective effects on BDL-induced liver injury in mice via LKB1/AMPK signaling [ 50 ]. In terms of our study, increased NO production (particularly derived from SECs) by AICAR may also largely improve subsequent liver fibrosis in BDL rats. We also found that AICAR could improve the inflammation processes in BDL rats though the AMPK/non-canonical NF-κB pathway, but the underlying mechanism needs further research.
