 Aberrant levels of miR-134 have been detected in various malignancies, and may regulate tumor development, differentiation, proliferation, invasion and metastasis ( 35 , 36 ). Overexpression of miR-134 inhibits migration, invasion and EMT of lung cancer cells by targeting integrin β1 mRNA ( 37 ). Similarly, Zha et al revealed that miR-134 specifically targets integrin β1 to suppress the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo ( 38 ). Additionally, forced expression of miR-134 inhibits the migration and invasion of renal cell carcinoma cells by blocking EMT ( 39 ). These findings indicated the miR-134 may serve as a tumor suppressor in human cancer ( 40 ); however, the pathogenetic roles of miR-134 were obscure in GC, particularly in GC associated with H. pylori infection. To the best of our knowledge, the current study was the first to reveal that forced overexpression of miR-134 could significantly reverse H. pyloriCₐgA₊/P₊ infection-induced cell proliferation, invasion and EMT. Notably, the molecular and modulated mechanisms of miRNA are complex and variable ( 41 ), and a recent study revealed that miR-134 has diverse target genes in cancer ( 40 ). Using bioinformatics analysis and molecular experiments, the present study demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-134 in H. pyloriCₐgA₊/P₊-infected GC tissues was associated with upregulated FoxM1 mRNA and protein expression. In agreement with the sequence alignment, the luciferase reporter assays confirmed the direct targeting of the FoxM1 3′-untranslated region by miR-134, and suggested that a strong affinity may exist between miR-134 and FoxM1 mRNA in patients with GC and H. pyloriCₐgA₊/P₊ infection.
