 Ma et al. elucidated the relationship between LOC554202 and miR-31 in chordoma 34 . They found that up-regulation of LOC554202 was associated with a decreased level of miR-31 in chordoma tissues. Moreover, silencing of LOC554202 or upregulation of miR-31 could repress the proliferation and migration/ invasion of chordoma cells. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), Yang et al. observed that the expression of miR-31 was negatively correlated with the expression of LOC55420 35 . Overexpression of LOC554202 increased Hep-2 cell proliferation, cell cycle and invasion and overexpression of miR-31 inhibited Hep-2 cell proliferation, cell cycle and invasion. Consequently, these studies suggested that miR-31 was a tumor repressor in tumor. Contrary to these conclusions, Xi and colleagues reported that over-expression of miR-31, as a oncomir, significantly enhanced proliferation and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells whereas downregulation of miR-31 repressed proliferation of lung cancer cells 36 . We are still a bit confused about the relationship between LOC554202 and miR-31, and also their biological functions in tumors. These studies indicated that LOC554202 and miR-31 may play different roles in different tumors.
