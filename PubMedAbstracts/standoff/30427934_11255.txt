 As an approach for screening of at-risk populations, we analyzed serum iron status and HFE genotypes in patients with end-stage hip OA under the age of 70. Given the previous findings from epidemiological studies, we estimated a three-fold increase in C282Y homozygous mutations in our patient cohort compared to the general population. Nevertheless, our data did not reveal a significant increase in HFE mutations nor laboratory signs of iron overload in our study population compared to age- and sex-matched individuals. In fact, C282Y homozygosity was even lower in prevalence than in the control population, the latter being in the expected range. Thus, our study does not suggest a benefit from HFE screening in younger patients with severe OA of the hip. A possible reason for not detecting an increase in C282Y homozygotes in the OA group is that subjects in our study were not primarily selected by iron overload and few suffered from elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. Further, it cannot be excluded that hemochromatosis patients with joint pain are being diagnosed and treated at earlier stages in Austria. In fact, many rheumatologists include full iron status in their diagnostic work-up of newly presenting patients. Also, a referral bias of certain patient groups cannot be fully excluded, although all recruiting centers are part of the social insurance system.
