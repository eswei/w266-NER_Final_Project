 ER-α36 (Estrogen receptor-alpha36), a member of ER superfamily with molecular weight 36 kDa, is a recently identified ER-α66 variant [ 11 ]. ER-α36 is responsible for estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation and development of ER-positive breast cancer [ 12 ]. A large amount of studies have reported that high-level expression of ER-α36 is closely related to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells and is one of the underlying mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance [ 13 – 15 ]. In breast cancer cells overexpressing ER-α36, tamoxifen displays estrogen-like effects and activates MAPK/ERK signaling mediated by ER-α36, which is also known as ER-α36-mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling, and thereby stimulates cell survival and proliferation [ 16 – 18 ]. Recent studies have shown the existence of the ER-α36-EGFR/HER-2 positive regulatory loops in either ER-α negative or ER-α positive breast cancer cells [ 19 , 20 ]. ER-α36 can physically interact with the EGFR/HER-2. EGFR signaling can activate ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter, and ER-α36 expression stabilizes EGFR protein or positively regulates HER-2 expression [ 20 , 21 ]. In tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/TAM), tamoxifen induces expression of ER-α36-EGFR/HER-2 positive regulatory loops and the destruction of the loops restores tamoxifen sensitivity [ 19 ]. The role of ER-α36-mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling in tamoxifen resistance has attracted considerable attention, however, the significance of ER-α36 in cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells has not been investigated.
