 Tissue RAS in Diabetic Retinopathy The initial step of circulatory RAS necessitates the indispensable process of proteolytic activation of prorenin, whereby prorenin is changed to its mature active form; that is, renin by the processing enzymes (e.g., cathepsin B) exclusively in juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney to digest the prorenin prosegment that folds into an active‐site cleft of renin. Renin is a rate‐limiting enzyme in circulatory RAS for the shedding of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I), which angiotensin‐converting enzyme changes to angiotensin II (Ang II), the effector molecule that binds to its cognate receptors, Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Ang II type 2 receptor. By contrast, tissue RAS is characterized by independence from the processing enzyme‐based proteolytic activation of prorenin to acquire renin activity, and requires an alternative triggering step caused by (P)RR, as discussed below. Tissue RAS plays several important roles in pathological vascular events, such as angiogenesis and inflammation, and various organ abnormalities are shown to be caused by tissue RAS activation. Regarding its relationship with the eye, multiple clinical trials, such as the EUCLID study, DIRECT‐Prevent 1, ‐Protect 1 and ‐Protect 2, and the RAS study, showed that inhibition of AT1R or angiotensin‐converting enzyme resulted in blood pressure‐unrelated beneficial effects on the incidence and progression of DR13, 14, 15, 16. Ang II levels were reported to significantly increase in the vitreous fluid of PDR eyes, with its significant correlation with VEGF levels17, 18. Furthermore, we have shown the significant involvement of the AngII/AT1R signaling pathway in inflammation‐related ocular angiogenesis, which causes upregulated expression of VEGF‐A, C‐C chemokine ligand (CCL)2/monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)‐1 and intercellular adhesion molecule‐119, 20, all of which were verified to be responsible for the pathogenesis of DR. These several reports indicate that the activation of tissue RAS in the diabetic eye is the major key event predisposing to the development and deterioration of DR.
