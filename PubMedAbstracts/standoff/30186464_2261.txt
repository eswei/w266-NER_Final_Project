 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of small and single-stranded non-coding RNAs that are >200 nt in size and evolutionarily conserved ( 6 , 7 ). Although lncRNAs exhibit no protein-coding capacity, they are key regulators of gene expression and serve important roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, migration, invasion and tumourigenesis ( 8 , 9 ). In recent years, evidence has suggested that lncRNAs serve promoting or tumour suppressive roles in the development and malignant progression of OSCC ( 10 , 11 ). For instance, lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 promotes progression of OSCC through upregulation of formin-like 2 by acting as molecular sponges for microRNA (miR)-219 ( 12 ). LncRNA maternally expressed 3 inhibits proliferation and metastasis of OSCC via regulation of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway ( 13 ). Recently, lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been observed to be upregulated in several human cancer types and studies have revealed its oncogenic role ( 14 – 16 ). For example, NEAT1 is regulated by the epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathway and contributes to glioblastoma progression through the WNT/β-catenin pathway by serving as a scaffold for enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ( 15 ). NEAT1 contributes to paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells through regulation of zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 expression via miR-194 ( 16 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, the function of NEAT1 in OSCC has not yet been reported.
