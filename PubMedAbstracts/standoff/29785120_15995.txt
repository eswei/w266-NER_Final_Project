 Previous studies have shown that NR5A2, which is also known as liver receptor homolog-1, is an important regulator of pancreatic exocrine function. 32 Lack of NR5A2, combined with pancreas-specific transcription factor 1 causes instability of pancreatic acinar cells, which increases the pancreatic injury and then causes mutations in the Kras gene. 10 , 32 – 34 As we all know, mutation of Kras is the earliest event in deterioration of pancreatic cancer. 11 We integrated the results of five studies and found a negative link between NR5A2 rs3790844 polymorphism and the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, histologic examinations show that NR5A2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, which is quiet puzzling. 35 Although the mechanism is not clear, it does not deny our conclusion that NR5A2 is a protective factor for early pancreatic cancer. Here, we put forward several possible explanations for discussion. Overexpression of NR5A2 is also closely related to diabetes and hyperlipidemia, which are the important risk factors for pancreatic cancer, and has a positive effect on mutation of Kras later in pancreatic cancer progression. 11 , 36 , 37 Moreover, NR5A2 also contributes to other tumors. For instance, NR5A2 was reported to be involved in the metabolism of glutamine to induce hepatocellular carcinoma, while it also induces the expression and transcription of ERα and mediates the secretion of estrogen to affect the progression of breast cancer. 38 – 40 In addition, NR5A2 is overexpressed in colon cancer and osteosarcoma cells. 41 , 42 Recently, many studies have reported the relationship between the NR5A2 rs3790843, rs3790844 and rs12029406 polymorphisms and the risk of cholangiocarcinoma, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer without consistent results. 13 , 18 – 22 , 43 In order to clarify the association, we integrated the data of pancreatic cancer for the meta-analysis.
