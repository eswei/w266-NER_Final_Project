 PIEZO1 and 2 are highly expressed in lung tissue. Knockdown of PIEZO1 in lung epithelial cells attenuated cell adherence and stimulated cell migration [ 18 ]. In particular, how lung mechanotransduction regulates lung tumor progression remains elusive. We investigated the expression and prognostic roles of PIEZO channels in NSCLC patients. Our data indicate that the expression of PIEZOs decreased in lung tumor tissues, which may result in the impaired function of PIEZO channels in LC patients [ 6 ]. Similar to LC, the expression of PIEZO1 is also down-regulated in radiation-induced thyroid tumors [ 43 ]. The potential molecular mechanisms leading to the decreased expression of PIEZOs were different. For PIEZO1, gene expression shows high frequency of deep deletion in human LC tissue. However, PIEZO2 expression shows a high mutation ratio in cancer tissue from NSCLC patients. The predicted roles of PIEZOs in NSCLC patients, both PIEZO1 and 2, are those involved in the suppression of tumor progression. The higher expression of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 was correlated to better OS for all NSCLC patients. Indeed, we provide compelling evidence that PIEZO1 and 2 have critical prognostic values in NSCLC. Meanwhile, Yoda1, an activator for activation or sensitization of membrane tension, and non-specific blockers of PIEZOs (such as gadolinium, ruthenium red, and streptomycin), have been reported to regulate PIEZO functions [ 44 ], which might be useful in understanding the heterogeneity and complexity of the molecular biological role of PIEZOs in the pathogenesis of NSCLC and other diseases. Our current study indicated that blocking the function of PIEZOs or knockout of the expression of PIEZOs promotes tumor formation, which may suggest that activators targetting PIEZOs would be a potential candidate for the treatment of NSCLC.
