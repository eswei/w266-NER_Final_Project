 Numerous researchers have suggested that MMPs play a critical role during vascular remodeling in diabetes, which is closely related to the comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile, the study of the mechanism on how DM upregulates MMPs is scarce. Our work indicates that CD147 is essential for the activity of MMPs in DM. Rats with DM showed upregulated expression of CD147, especially HG-CD147 on astrocytes and endothelium, followed by elevated MMP activity in both ischemic brain tissue and serum. CD147, as an important MMP-regulating protein, has been extensively studied in tumor research and has been proven to participate in multiple processes, including cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. In CNS biology, alongside induction of MMPs, CD147 is also involved in homeostasis [ 35 ]. But the function of CD147 in ischemic stroke under the diabetic condition is poorly understood. Portik-Dobos et al. explored CD147 function in cardiac artery specimens from DM patients and concluded that CD147 decreased the activity of MMPs, which might contribute to the increased collagen deposition and pathological remodeling observed in diabetes [ 36 ]. In contrast, Abu et al. suggested that CD147 upregulated the activity of MMPs and that the CD147/MMPs/VEGF pathway was involved in proliferative diabetic retinopathy angiogenesis [ 37 ]. Our conclusive results are in accordance with the latter study, and the reason may be that CD147 function differs between tissues.
