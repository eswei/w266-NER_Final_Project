 Among all the voltage-gated ion channels, potassium channels (K⁺ channels) have attracted most of the attentions in regard to the relationship with human cancers because K⁺ channels constitute the largest heterogeneous family, such as voltage-gated K⁺ (Kᵥ) channels, calcium-activated K⁺ (KCₐ) channels, inwardly rectifying K⁺ (Kᵢᵣ) channels, and two-pore K⁺ (K₂ₚ) channels, with more than eighty genes encoding membrane proteins that control membrane potential [ 20 ]. More importantly, K⁺ channels play a pivotal role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of various tumor cells and have been considered as new targets for designing cancer treatment strategies [ 20 21 ]. For example, Kᵥ channels have been found to be involved in the proliferation of uterine and breast cancer cells [ 22 23 ]. Similarly, the activation of KCₐ channels has been shown to drive tumor cell proliferation in astrocytoma and glioma [ 24 25 ]. Actually, increasing evidences indicate that, instead of a single subfamily of K⁺ channel being present in tumor cells from tissues such as colon, prostate, and breast, a variety of K⁺ channels are found in these tissues [ 17 ]. For example, the expression of Kᵥ, KCₐ, and K₂ₚ channels has been reported in prostate cancer cells [ 26 27 28 ].
