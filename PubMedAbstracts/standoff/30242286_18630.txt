 We aimed to investigate the relationship between LGI setting, increased levels of LTB4, and how this would affect the wound healing process in diabetic mice. We found that in peripheral blood from diabetic mice, the increased levels of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10) were dependent on leukotrienes as well as monocytes reprogramming towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by the increased frequency of the CD11b⁺Ly6Cʰⁱᵍʰ population. Resident peritoneal macrophages from diabetic WT mice bear a classically activated-like phenotype (higher Stat1 and Nos2 expression, and higher NO levels), while macrophages from diabetic 5LO−/− mice exhibit an alternatively activated phenotype (higher Arg1 and Ym1 expression, and higher activity of arginase). In the absence of leukotrienes, the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT6, and increased gene expression of STAT6 product genes (Arg1, Chi3l3) were observed when macrophages were stimulated with IL-4. Skin wound healing in diabetic WT mice was impaired and this correlated with the decreased frequency of alternatively activated macrophages (CD45⁺F4/80⁺CD206⁺) in the lesions.
