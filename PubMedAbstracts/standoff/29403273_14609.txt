 Current studies have demonstrated that CyPA is involved in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, viral infection, cancer, nervous system degeneration, asthma, and periodontitis. 18 , 23 â€“ 29 Proteomic analysis has found that the expression of CyPA is upregulated in smokers and particularly notable in COPD smokers. 30 However, alterations of serum CyPA in COPD patients remain unclear. Our present study showed that serum CyPA levels were increased in convalescent COPD patients compared to healthy controls, and further elevated in COPD patients with acute exacerbation. The major reason for the upregulation of serum CyPA concentration in COPD patients may be due to the inflammatory stimuli and oxidative stress. In addition, it has been reported that extracellular CyPA binds to extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN, CD147) and thereby initiates a cascade of inflammatory processes such as leucocyte chemotaxis and induction of MMP-9 and IL-6 expression. 31 , 32 Therefore, we further evaluated serum concentrations of IL-6 and MMP-9 in COPD patients. Serum levels of IL-6 and MMP-9 were also increased in convalescent COPD patients and further increased in exacerbated COPD patients. Correlation analysis showed that CyPA positively correlated with IL-6 and MMP-9 in COPD patients with acute exacerbation and convalescence phases, suggesting that CyPA can strengthen its effect through the induction of IL-6 and MMP-9 expression.
