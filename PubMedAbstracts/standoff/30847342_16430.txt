 The mutation p.Cys548Tyr in KLKB1, found in two patients from family 1 and one asymptomatic mutation carrier from family 27 (F12-HAE), has been associated with KK deficiency in a compound heterozygosity with the change p.Trp402Ter ( 25 ). KK deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition which causes an augmented activated partial thromboplastin time, but no coagulation anomalies. Therefore, coexistence of KK deficiency could attenuate or even abolish the symptoms of HAE, since it is the key enzyme responsible for BK release. The only missense mutation found together with p.Cys548Tyr was the high frequent polymorphism p.Ser143Asn (66/78). This polymorphism was shown to cause KK deficiency with the change p.Gly125Arg, both in homozygosity ( 26 ) and lying in the apple domain 2 of the heavy chain of KK, through which kallikrein interacts with HMWK domain 6 ( 27 ). However, p.Ser143Asn was found in heterozygosity in the three patients carrying the p.Cys548Tyr, discarding the hypothesis that this association could be responsible by itself for the lack of symptoms observed in the F12-HAE carrier. Furthermore, the Cys548 lies in the catalytic domain of KK, far from the apple domain 2.
