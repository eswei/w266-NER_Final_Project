 Glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinylglycine) is a major intracellular antioxidant and plays a key role in reducing the effects of oxidative stress [ 10 , 11 ]. Several investigators have reported that erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) concentration is decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 12 – 15 ]. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for glutathione deficiency in type 2 diabetes have not been fully established. We are aware of one study in which GSH synthesis rate was directly measured and those data showed diminished synthesis rates in uncontrolled diabetes [ 16 ]. In another study, synthesis although low, was not directly measured, but imputed from the expression of GSH synthetic enzymes [ 17 ]. Nevertheless, irreversible utilization may also play a role in reducing GSH concentration. Whereas Afro-Caribbean patients with type 2 diabetes had similar concentrations of total erythrocyte glutathione levels [ 18 ] to non-diabetic controls, the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) was decreased and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels were higher [ 18 ] suggesting increased utilization. It is unclear whether impaired glutathione metabolism is a cause or consequence of hyperglycemia although there is some evidence for the later [ 16 ]. Although oxidative stress is significantly increased in the presence of microvascular complications [ 19 ], it is not clear if patients with complications have more impaired glutathione metabolism compared to diabetic patients without complications.
