 To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying circHECTD1/miR-1256-mediated GC progression, we explored the downstream effectors. Bioinformatics prediction suggested that USP5, a member of the deubiquitinase family, was a downstream target of miR-1256. USP5 contributes to the carcinogenesis of multiple tumors, including lung cancer ²³ , pancreatic cancer ³⁶ , multiple myeloma ³⁷ , liver cancer ³⁸ , and glioblastoma ³⁹ . In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression level of USP5 was increased in GC and that USP5 is a downstream target of the circHECTD1/miR-1256 axis. In addition, previous studies showed that USP5 is involved in β-catenin stabilization ²³ , ²⁴ . In non-small cell lung cancer, USP5 deubiquitinates β-catenin and leads to the activation of the β-catenin/c-Myc signaling pathway ²³ . USP5 can also activate β-catenin/c-Myc signaling via stabilizing FoxM1 ²⁴ . The β-catenin/c-Myc signaling pathway is regarded as one of the crucial regulatory pathways responsible for glutaminolysis and cancer progression. In tumor cells, β-catenin signaling is activated and consequently provokes c-Myc-mediated glutaminolysis ⁴⁰ . On the one hand, c-Myc can directly increase the expression levels of the surface transporters SN2 and SLC1A5. On the other hand, c-Myc can indirectly activate GLS1 via suppressing miR-23a/b ⁴¹ , ⁴² . Thus, the activation of β-catenin/c-Myc can drive glutaminolysis. Liu et al. reported that gankyrin leads to enhanced glutaminolysis by upregulating β-catenin/c-Myc signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma ⁶ . Our data revealed that the circHECTD1/miR-1256/USP5 pathway regulated GC progression by modulating β-catenin expression and downstream c-Myc levels.
