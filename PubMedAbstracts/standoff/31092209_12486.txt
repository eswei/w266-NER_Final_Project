 Genetic detection of the patient indicated ApoE ε4 homozygosity and a variant in SORL1 (chromosome11, c.4901A>T) (Fig. 2), which was fairly rare in the normal population. Strong support for a causal involvement in neurodegenerative disease came with genetic studies associating SORL1 gene variants with the occurrence of sporadic AD [ 13 ]. SORL1 encodes a 250-kDa protein named sorting protein-related receptor with A-type repeats (SorLA), decreasing production and deposition of Aβ peptide as a proposed modulator of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing [ 13 , 18 ]. Aβ levels are mainly determined by the kinetic of SorLA and APP interaction according to the mathematic model which supports the fact that APP sorting pathway is a very important factor in defining the risk of AD [ 13 , 19 , 20 ]. CAA-ri is thought to result from an inflammatory response to Aβ protein in the blood vessel walls [ 5 ]. Spontaneous ARIA and CAA-ri have also been described in familial forms of AD (FAD), i.e., in β-amyloid protein precursor -amyloid protein precursor (AβPP) duplication carriers [ 21 ], in presenilin 1-associated FAD (I202F PSEN1 mutation) [ 12 ], and in two siblings carrying the P284S PSEN1 mutation [ 22 ]. Thus, SORL1 may be associated with CAA-ri. A variant in SORL1 may give rise to the risk of CAA-ri via immune response to Aβ excessive deposition. ApoE ε4 homozygosity known to associate with increased burden of Aβ deposition in vessels [ 11 ] is strongly associated with CAA-ri [ 4 , 5 , 12 ] and may potentiate the intense inflammatory response [ 23 ]. Investigation of the degree of CAA-ri and inflammation in SORL1 mutation with ApoE ε4 homozygosity would be an interesting avenue for future research.
