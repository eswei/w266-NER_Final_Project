 In this study, we present interesting correlations between miR-143/miR-145 and steroid hormone receptors expressed in the NSCLC tissue. The finding of gender specific survival significance of miR-143 and miR-145, forces us to consider sex hormones as a relevant factor. Delfino et al. ⁴⁰ reported a gender-specific miRNA targeting of molecules related to glioblastoma survival. Further, Duttagupta et al. ⁴¹ reported differential miRNA expression levels in a gender specific manner. Mounting evidence confirms activation of hormone receptors to be of outmost importance in lung cancer pathogenesis and several interesting cross-talk pathways between steroid hormones and miR-143/miR-145 have been found ⁴² – ⁴⁶ . Both miRNAs play a critical role in ovarian functioning, and a recent report presents miR-143 affecting estradiol production in granulosa cells by targeting KRAS ⁴⁷ , ⁴⁸ . Further, Spizzo et al., 2011 reported that miR-145 downregulates ERα expression in breast cancer ¹¹ . We found correlations between miR-143/miR-145 and AR, the rate limiting enzyme in estradiol production, suggesting the miRs may interact with regional estradiol production and ER signaling in the lung, as observed in breast tissue. In 2012, Paris et al. presented a study on estrogen effects in breast cancer, showing a direct regulation of miRNA expression and ERβ signaling ⁴⁹ . Herein, ERβ expression correlated with miR-143/miR-145 expression, suggesting a similar link may exist in NSCLC. The aforementioned reports, assembled with our findings, provide a compelling rationale for a biological cross-talk between miR-143/miR-145 and hormone receptors. If validated in larger, confirmatory studies, this may in fact represent new possibilities for targeted therapy for NSCLC patients, using gender, miRNA and hormone receptor expression as therapy selection criteria.
