 Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine series, is a first-line chemotherapeutic drug for clinically treating malignant gliomas. Nevertheless, gradually increasing drug resistance to TMZ has obviously decreased its therapeutic effects in glioma patients. A previous study suggested that blockade of the Hedgehog/GLI1-regulated IGF-1 pathways countered the intrinsic and acquired resistance of glioma stem cells to TMZ [ 20 ]. The mechanisms of IGF-1-influenced TMZ resistance in glioma cells are still unclear. Furthermore, no studies have reported if IGF-1-regulated miRNAs participate in drug resistance or glioma progression. In the present study, we attempted to identify IGF-1-influenced miRNA networks in reducing glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ treatment. Using microarray and bioinformatic analyses, we found that miR-513a-5p was the most upregulated miRNA in IGF-1-treated U87-MG cells through PI3K pathways. NEDD4L, identified as a direct target gene of miR-513a-5p, was significantly downregulated in GBM patients and IGF-1-treated glioma cells. Overexpression of NEDD4L significantly reduced glioma cell viability. Finally, our results suggest that IGF-1-upregulated miR-513a-5p signaling attenuated glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ via inhibiting NEDD4L-inactivated WNT/Î²-catenin pathways.
