 Cancer-associated alterations in metabolic enzymes influence the levels of metabolic intermediates and may thereby impact non-metabolic cellular functions such as signaling and the epigenetic state ⁵ , ¹³ . For example, succinate and fumarate accumulate in cancers with SDH or FH mutations and may exert their pro-tumorigenic effects by acting as epigenetic modulators ²² , ²³ . Here, we find that ALK+ ALCLs lose squalene monooxygenase activity and accumulate squalene, a metabolite with antioxidant-like properties (Fig. 4f). As activation of cellular antioxidant defenses is selected for in some tumor types ²⁴ or under certain stresses ²¹ , ²⁵ , ²⁶ and may protect cancer cells from ferroptosis ²⁷ , SQLE suppression may be an additional mechanism underlying this cancer hallmark. Future work is required to understand the role of squalene accumulation in cancer initiation and progression. Additionally, our work identifies cholesterol auxotrophy of ALK+ ALCLs as a targetable metabolic liability and adds ALCLs to the small list of cancers that are selectively auxotrophic for a particular nutrient. As a block in LDL uptake inhibits the growth of ALCL tumors in our pre-clinical PDX models, inhibitors of LDLR, or approaches that decrease serum cholesterol without increasing tumor LDLR levels, might have value in the clinic ²⁸ . Lastly, the workflow we describe can serve as a generalizable approach for identifying additional nutrient dependencies and protumorigenic metabolites across cancer types.
