 4 DISCUSSION The main finding of this work is that therole of miR‐186 in the pathogenesis of COPD is the regulation of HIF‐1α expression. Previously, we used miRNA‐ChIP and reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) to assess the distribution and differences in miRNA expression in the peripheral blood of COPD patients in comparison to normal subjects. The results showed 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed between COPD patients and the control subjects. Further research using RT‐PCR confirmed that the expression levels of the following seven miRNAs were significantly different: hsa‐miR‐146b‐5p, hsa‐miR‐141‐3p, hsa‐miR‐186‐5p, hsa‐miR‐4532, hsa‐miR‐4635, hsa‐miR‐2681‐3p, hsa‐miR‐4503, and hsa‐miR‐196b‐5p (Ding et al., 2016). To investigate whether these miRNAs are associated with COPD, we conducted further experiments in which miRNAs were transfected into human lung fibroblasts. The results showed that in comparison with control cells, human lung fibroblasts transfected with miR‐146b‐5p and miR‐141‐3p had decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation, and cells transfected with hsa‐miR‐186 had increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Cells transfected with miR‐196b‐5p showed no significant phenotypes. According to the results, miR‐146b and miR‐141 upregulation accelerated MRC‐5 cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, and miR‐186 upregulation slowed MRC‐5 cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The imbalance of apoptosis and proliferation in pulmonary fibroblasts is an important factor in the reconstruction of COPD airways (Zheng‐Xing, Bo, & Zhou, 2013); therefore, regulating the function of fibroblasts, including inducing apoptosis and inhibiting their proliferation, are targets of COPD treatment. Based on these previous observations, we chose miR‐186 for further study. MicroRNA‐186 (miR‐186) has turned out to be one of the most important determinants of cell proliferation in various types of cancers (Cai et al., 2013; Ruan, Xiaoting, Jun, & Hang, 2016; Zhang et al., 2010). COPD is a chronic systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by irreversible, progressive airflow obstruction (Thorleifsson et al., 2009). HIF‐1α is a critical factor responsible for maintaining oxygen homeostasis under hypoxic conditions, and this transcription factor is thought to be associated with the development and progression of COPD (Putra et al., 2013). In recent years, HIF‐1α has emerged as a key factor in COPD. HIF‐1 also plays a major role in the expression of genes involved in inflammation, energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and airway remodeling (Balamurugan, 2016). The role of HIF in the development and progression of COPD has also been demonstrated. For instance, previous studies showed that HIF‐1 plays an important role in critical pathological processes of pulmonary heart disease in patients with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and COPD (Fan et al., 2011; Manalo et al., 2005; Qian, Wang, Ming, & Liang, 2012; Schultz, Fanburg, & Beasley, 2006; Xie et al., 2017). Our results showed that mir‐186 has a binding site in the 3′‐UTR of HIF‐1α. We found that mir‐186 can affect apoptosis of inflammatory fibroblasts via regulation of HIF‐1α and affect the downstream signaling pathways.
