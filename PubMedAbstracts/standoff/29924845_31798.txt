 Our data on the co-inheritance of PTPN22 variant genotype (TT) and HLA-DQ alleles show that T1DM patients who had the homozygous variant PTPN22 genotype (TT), always carried one or more of the high risk DQ alleles (DQ 2–2, 2–3, 2–5, 2–8 and 8–8, Fig 4). In Kuwaiti T1DM patients who carried the TT genotype, 93% had at least one DQ2 or a DQ8 allele. Similarly, the homozygosity for the variant PTPN22 genotype was found to be associated with one or more of the ‘high risk’ HLA-DR alleles (Fig 5). This strongly suggest that the PTPN22 gene variant (C1858T, rs2476601) along with specific HLA DQ/DR alleles (mentioned above) constitute strong risk factors in conferring susceptibility to T1DM in Kuwaiti Arabs. This is in contrast to some previous reports which showed that the strength of the association between T1DM and PTPN22 gene variant (C1858T, rs2476601), decreased in patients with high risk genotypes e.g. HLA-DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 [ 49 , 60 – 61 ]. We carried out epistasis analysis to investigate gene-gene interaction between the PTPN22 and HLA-DQ/DR genotypes with regard to their impact on susceptibility to T1DM. In the case-only analytical approach employed, our data (Tables 3 and 4) highlight these two candidate genes/loci as independent determinants for susceptibility to T1DM in Kuwait Arabs. This is not surprising because of the known biological role of these two loci in the auto-immune process; HLA being involved in presenting the auto-antigens while PTPN22 gene product (LYP) serving as a key component of the intra-cellular signaling pathway [ 18 ].
