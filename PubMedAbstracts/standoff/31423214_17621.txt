 The miR-125a/let-7e/miR-99b cluster or its members may be involved in human pathological processes. miR-99b/let-7e/miR-125a cluster may promote metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) ( 25 ). Overexpression of this miRNA cluster was demonstrated to induce ESCC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and experimental metastasis in vivo ( 25 ). The miR-125a/let-7e/miR-99b cluster members were also shown to be upregulated in synovial sarcomas, however only two cluster members, let-7e and miR-99b, promoted cancer cell proliferation ( 26 ). Similarly, two cluster members, miR-99b and miR-125a, were previously implicated in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis ( 21 ). Decreased expression level of miR-125a, but not of miR-99b or let-7e, was identified in hepatocellular carcinoma biopsies compared with normal liver tissues, and predicted poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( 27 ). miR-125a-5p has been reported to be a potential tumor suppressor in lung carcinoma cells ( 28 ), retinoblastoma ( 29 ) and cervical carcinoma ( 30 ). All of these studies support that these miRNAs may have diverse functions in disease. In accordance with the aforementioned studies, the results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of miR-125a-5p was downregulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues.
