 Rather than a traditional growth factor, FGF21 is considered to be a metabolic hormone. There are mounting evidences that demonstrate the role of FGF21 as a hormone regulating glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism ( 11 ). Data from liver specific knockout animals showed that circulating FGF21 mainly produced in liver ( 1 ). In humans, FGF21 is also considered nearly exclusively produced by liver ( 12 ). So FGF21 is regarded as a kind of hepatokine, namely, proteins secreted by hepatocytes that can influence metabolic processes through autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signaling ( 13 ). As a heptokine, FGF21 was widely studied in NAFLD and other liver diseases. A large body of evidence showed that Hepatic steatosis, an underlying feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), induced changes in FGF21 secretion ( 14 , 15 ). In human being, FGF21 is also identified as a biomarker of liver injury. Susan Kralisch et al. demonstrated that FGF21 serum levels are positively associated with hepatic enzymes including ALT, AST ( 4 ). In NAFLD, FGF21 was found as a biomarker of hepatic apoptosis ( 2 ). Further longevity studies also confirmed serum FGF21 as a marker of liver damage ( 3 ).
