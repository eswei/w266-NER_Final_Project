 Results Bioinformatics Identifies DEGs in LUAD and Non-malignant Tissues Four gene expression datasets of LUAD in the GEO database, including GSE7670, GSE10072, GSE68465, and GSE43458, were used for identification of genes differentially expressed in lung cancer. The intersecting part of the four sets of DEGs consisted of 48 genes, which were thought to be involved in development and progression of this malignancy (Table 1). Among the 48 DEGs, 30 were upregulated in tumor tissues (Figure 1A). Impressively, the gene ceacam5, encoding the most common serum biomarker CEA for diagnosis of lung cancer, was on the list of upregulated genes, providing convincing evidence of the efficacy of the DEG profile. Next, to gain insight into the biological roles of DEGs involved in cancer progression, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Most of the enriched GO terms belonged to the biological process category. Collagen catabolic and fibril organization processes were the two most relevant biological processes, and nearly half of the terms involved regulating collagen assembly or disassembly through proteolysis. In terms of the cellular component, the enriched GO terms were mainly related to the ECM. Of the 10 enriched GO molecular functions, 4 were associated with endopeptidase activity (Figure 1B). PPI combined with ontologic analysis revealed common pathways or processes associated with upregulated genes in LUAD (Figure 1C), including ECM-receptor interaction, bladder cancer, elevated chemokine-related signaling, protein digestion, and absorption ontologies. Besides the chemokine-signaling-related factors CXCL13 and CXCL14, most of the upregulated genes belong to the collagen and MMP families. We propose that the DEGs encoding MMPs or collagens found in this study may play critical roles in the development of LUAD. Large studies have demonstrated that MMPs and collagens contribute to the progression of cancer by modulating the tumor microenvironment. 20 , 21 , 22 MMPs, as enzymes with peptidase activity taking an active role in ECM remodeling, are thought to be key players in this process.
