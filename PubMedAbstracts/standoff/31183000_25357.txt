 It has been widely demonstrated that inhibiting the activity of some HDAC molecules could alleviate liver failure. Our previous study showed that HDAC broad-spectrum inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) could effectively suppress the release of some inflammatory factors, improve liver and small intestine injury, increase the survival rate, and provide a protective effect in ALF or ACLF rats [ 31 ]. Another specific histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor, CY-1215, also known as ricolinostat, has reported many other effects such as anti-cancer [ 32 ], improvement of pulmonary fibrosis [ 33 ], and alleviation of peripheral neuropathy [ 34 ]. Our previous study has also demonstrated that ACY-1215 could inhibit the inflammatory response through the TLR4-MAPK/NF-ÎºB pathway in ALF rats [ 35 ]. A clinical study has shown that the activities of HDAC1 and HDAC2 are obviously elevated in the patients with chronic hepatitis B, especially in the patients with liver failure. The downregulated HDAC1 could reduce the production of inflammatory factors [ 36 ]. However, whether the HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) plays an anti-hepatocyte apoptosis role in liver failure is still kept unknown at present. Many evidences have demonstrated that HDACi can inhibit the apoptosis in some tissue parenchymal cells or functional cells apart from cancer cells. It has been shown that TSA could attenuate apoptosis during acute lung injury [ 37 ]. Similarly, HDAC broad-spectrum inhibitor sodium butyrate could improve cardiac function and suppress myocardial remodeling in diabetic mice through decreasing the active caspase 3 protein level and the amounts of apoptosis myocardial cells [ 38 ]. Another HDAC broad-spectrum inhibitor, sulforaphane (SFN), significantly inhibits the apoptosis of LPS-induced porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells [ 39 ].
