 In our previous study, we established the first complete lncRNA expression microarray profile in seven pairs of LSCC tissues, which can be obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) by searching the accession number GSE59652 (<url>) ¹² . To verify the microarray result that AC026166.2-001 is down-regulated in LSCC tissues, we expanded the sample size to 87 paired surgical samples and metastatic neck lymph nodes. The final results showed that AC026166.2-001 is down-regulated in laryngeal cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues and is reduced in metastatic cervical lymph nodes. There was no distinct relationship between AC026166.2-001 and clinicopathological features; however, survival data suggested that lower levels of AC026166.2-001 in tumor tissues were significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Additionally, AC026166.2-001 could be a potential biomarker for LSCC diagnosis as the area under the ROC curve was 0.65. Although down-regulated AC026166.2-001 has been demonstrated to contribute to the development of LSCC, its functional role in LSCC remains largely unknown.
