 Here, we found that IL-1 activity may contribute to fibrosis by inducing IL-6 and TGF-β expression in skin fibroblast and resulted in increased fibrosis in BLM-induced SSc model. We identified that exacerbated fibrosis and inflammation by IL-1 activity shown in vivo is largely dependent on IL-17. IL-1β, one of proinflammatory cytokine, has been unrevealed to promote collagen synthesis and aggregate fibrosis, suggesting its pro-fibrotic property ( 30 , 31 ). Previous studies have demonstrated the abnormally high activities of IL-1 as well as IL-1 receptor in SSc patients ( 32 , 33 ), indicating the pathophysiological roles of IL-1 signal transduction in SSc. Recently, Wilson et al. reported that intratracheal administration of IL-1β induces pulmonary fibrosis similar to BLM-induced fibrosis model, which is dependent on IL-17 activity ( 34 ). Their study is consistent with our findings showing that BLM-induced tissue fibrosis was exacerbated by systemically increased IL-1 activity through IL-1Ra depletion. Here, we demonstrated that IL-1 and IL-17, located in the downstream signal of IL-1, are important therapeutic targets for fibrosis inhibition of SSc. Furthermore, we identified that blocking the IL-1 receptor in vivo by anakinra administration significantly attenuated BLM-induced tissue fibrosis.
