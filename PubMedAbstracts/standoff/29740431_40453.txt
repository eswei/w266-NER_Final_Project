 Upregulated VCAM-1 in the CSF could distinguish CLIPPERS from both HS and RMS. Increased concentration of ICAM-1 was also observed compared to HS and as a trend when compared to RMS. These are key molecules in adhesion of lymphocytes and monocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, increase expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by endothelial cells ( 40 ). Indeed, increased concentration of IL-8 (CXCL8) in the CSF also differentiated CLIPPERS from HS, and there was a trend of elevated levels compared to RMS. IL-8 is produced by endothelial and glial cells, and mediates chemotaxis and neutrophil effector functions; neuroprotective and neurotrophic functions of CXCL8 are also emerging ( 41 ). Another chemokine eotaxin (CCL11) was also able to separate CLIPPERS from HS and RMS. Based on these findings, we suggest that upregulation of key molecules in chemotaxis, such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-8 (CXCL8), and eotaxin (CCL11) may serve as biomarkers for differentiating CLIPPERS from RMS. Moreover, GCSF could also differentiate CLIPPERS from HS and its upregulation may be a protective mechanism in response to inflammation ( 42 ). The tyrosine kinase sFlt-1 (VEGFR-1) was downregulated compared to HS. This molecule binds free placental growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, suppressing the proangiogenic effects ( 43 ). Thus, downregulation of sFlt-1 in CSF may indicate a net proangiogenic function in CLIPPERS.
