 The SIK family is a novel protein kinase family that comprises SIK1, SIK2 and SIK3. SIK1 is an important regulator of early-phase ACTH signaling in the adrenal cortex, and SIK2 is an important regulator of early-phase insulin signaling in adipose tissues 9 . SIK2 has been reported as a centrosome kinase that initiates mitosis. High expression of SIK2 was significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer 13 , 14 . SIK3 has also been shown to be an important mitotic regulator and a druggable antimitotic target 25 . From our previous study, we identified SIK3 as a novel ovarian TAA that is highly and preferentially expressed in ovarian cancer but not in benign gynecologic diseases, i.e., adenomyosis or endometriosis, with elevated CA125 levels. Increased expression of SIK3 promotes G1/S phase cell cycle progression and induces cell proliferation via the activation of the c-Src-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) linkage, with subsequent downregulation of p21 Waf/Cip1 and consequent increase in tumorigenesis in mice 16 . However, in our clinical cohort analysis, we found that EOC patients with high SIK3 expression had better survival outcomes (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 1, and Table 2), especially in advanced serous EOC (Figure 3). Among the factors including presurgery serum CA125, tissue CA125, and SIK3 expression, only high tissue SIK3 expression predicted a better prognosis in advanced EOC patients. Because almost all advanced EOC patients received adjuvant Taxol/platinum chemotherapy, chemosensitivity likely influenced the prognosis. Indeed, we found that stage III/IV ovarian cancer patients with high expression of SIK3 are more chemosensitive than patients with low expression of SIK3 (Table 1, P=0.01, Fisher's exact test). This observation may explain why advanced serous EOC patients with high SIK3 expression showed a better prognosis.
