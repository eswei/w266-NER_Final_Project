 Hepatic lipase (LIPC), a member of the lipase family, is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15 q21) and has a total length of 35 kb, comprising nine exons and eight introns [ 7 â€“ 10 ]. LIPC encodes hepatic triglyceride lipase, which is an extracellular protein synthesized by liver parenchyma cells and plays a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism. Hepatic lipase serves an important role inremodeling of low-density liporprotein, high-density lipoprotein, remnant, and the production of small, dense low density lipoprotein [ 11 ]. A previous study reported that the lipids and lipoprotein concentrations in blood serum are significantly correlated with primary hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia [ 12 ]. Additionally, the triglycerides and the triglyceride to high-density liproprotein cholesterol ratio are strongly correlated with the incidence hypertension in Middle Eastern women [ 13 ]. These findings indicate that disruptions of hepatic lipase is a risk factor for hypertension. The -514C/T (rs1800588) and -250G/A (rs2070895) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are two common variants in the promoter region of LIPC and both present obvious chain imbalance [ 7 , 8 ]. LIPC mutation may be related to the occurrence of a variety of diseases. The -514 T allele of LIPC is associated with the occurrence of insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes [ 14 ]. The LIPC-250G/A loci polymorphism is related to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia [ 15 ]. Recent studies showed that mutations in the liver lipase gene are associated with coronary heart disease and cerebral infarction [ 16 , 17 ]. The relationships between LIPC polymorphisms and metabolic diseases have been widely examined.
