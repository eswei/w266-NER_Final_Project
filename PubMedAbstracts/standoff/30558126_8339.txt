 Similar to our results, a few previous in vivo/in vitro studies have demonstrated that silica dust exposure could increase the expression levels of HMGB-1. For instance, Zhang et al. found that SiOâ‚‚ induced a rapid and sustained increase of HMGB-1 expression in RAW264.7 cells [ 16 ]. Laurie et al. reported that the expression of HMGB-1 in lung tissues was significantly elevated by intratracheal instillation crystalline silica suspension in mice [ 14 ]. Although the above-mentioned studies provide important evidence that long-term silica could induce HMGB-1 overexpression, whether the elevated HMGB-1 also played an important role in the development of silica-induced lung fibrosis is still largely unknown. Previous studies have suggested that HMGB-1 is significantly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). For instance, Hamada et al. reported that the concentrations of HMGB-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were significantly increased in subjects with IPF [ 17 ]. Abe et al. found that the concentrations of HMGB-1 in serum were increased in IPF with acute exacerbation [ 18 ]. In agreement with previous studies, our results show that the elevated HMGB-1 level was significantly associated with higher odds of silicosis. These results indicate that the HMGB-1-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway might be involved in the process of silicosis.
