 A growing body of literature showing evidence that a solid pathological association between chronic low-grade inflammation and carcinogenesis [ 25 ]. High sensitive CRP, an acute-phase reactant synthesized in the liver that is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily interleukin (IL) 6 [ 26 ]. It has been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with different types of cancer, which including HCC [ 26 ]. In this study, hsCRP was found to elevated in HCC patients when compared to healthy volunteers. In this context, the previous studies showing compelling evidence that systemic inflammation is known to associate with tumor development and poor survival in patients with HCC [ 3 , 11 ]. In addition, a moderate increase of hsCRP showed to predict recurrence and survival in patients with early-stage HCC [ 27 ]. Further, it has been demonstrated that a novel prognostic scoring system, which includes the CRP level, predict overall survival in late-stage HCC following treatment with Sorafenib [ 28 ]. Shin et al., found that increased serum CRP concentration indicates poor prognosis in patients with HCC [ 29 ]. Also, increased immunoreactivity of CRP is considered a key feature of inflammatory hepatic adenomas with an increased risk of malignant transformation [ 29 ]. Furthermore, the ratio of hsCRP and albumin predicted outcomes in patients with HCC [ 30 ] and considered a novel inflammation-based prognostic score. We found decreased albumin concentrations in HCC patients compared to healthy control. However, there is no correlation between elevated hsCRP and lowered albumin levels in HCC.
