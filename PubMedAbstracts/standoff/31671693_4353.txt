 2. Results 2.1. Identification of Mutations in AR and CYP11A1 Case No.1: The AR sequence of this individual revealed a novel mutation within the first exon in the N-terminal transactivation domain (NTD). Thymine deletion in the NTD (c.840delT) resulted in a frameshift and introduction of a premature stop codon at amino acid 282 (Figure 1A). Case No.2: The AR sequence of this individual revealed a mutation within the seventh exon in the ligand domain. The C>T substitution (c.2491C>T) resulted in an amino acid change from Leucine to Phenylalanine at position 831 (Figure 1B). Case No.3: Sanger sequencing did not detect a mutation in the coding region of the AR gene. Therefore, we decided to use the RNA-seq results and identify the SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) variants, because in this case we only had the RNA material. Analysis of RNA-Seq data indicated a heterozygous mutation in the CYP11A1 gene, which was subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mutation was a G>T substitution (c.73G>T), which resulted in a frameshift and introduction of a premature stop codon at amino acid 25 referring to the reference sequence NM_000781 (Figure 1C).
