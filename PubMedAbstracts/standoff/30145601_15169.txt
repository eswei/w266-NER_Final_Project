 Initially, our results implied that decreased serum NGF level might be associated with the incidence to DPN. NGF was a neurotrophic factor, which played a significant role in the adult peripheral nervous system and has been studied as a potential therapy for DPN [ 24 ]. NGF is known for affecting the phenotype of mature nociceptors receptors as well as normal development of the embryonic nervous system, and changes in NGF levels are involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain conditions like neuropathic pain [ 25 ]. Decreased expression of NGF protein and its 2 receptors, TrkA and the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, are positively correlated with the death of neurons in clinical diabetes, which further confirms that it is associated with the occurrence and development of DPN [ 24 , 26 ]. Moreover, the results of our study showed that increasing NGF level could protect against DPN. Similarly, recent research has suggested that vitamin A may reverse injuries in nerve and restore functional changes caused by DPN upon inducing the expression of NGF [ 27 ]. In addition, Li et al. have suggested that NGF could alleviate high glucose-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress which triggers progression of DPN, and that treatment with exogenous NGF could repair the structure of the sciatic nerve in DPN rats [ 28 ]. Furthermore, KANG TH et al. found that through upregulation of NFG, diosgenin could release its neuroprotective effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy in diabetic rodent model [ 29 ], which is coincident with the findings of our study.
