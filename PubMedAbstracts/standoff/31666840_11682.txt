 Similarly, other studies found that hs-CRP was significantly elevated in PHT patients. They added that inflammation is a contributing factor to the progression of pulmonary hypertension [ 15 ], [ 16 ], hs-CRP is one of the short pentraxins and is strongly released secondary to inflammation. To clarify our results, multiple correlations were calculated between serum pentraxin3 and all other variables. It showed that PAP was positively correlated with serum pentraxin 3. This may be explained by that pentraxin 3 has a role in angiogenesis and vascular diseases. It is secreted at sites of inflammation not only by endothelial cells but also by macrophages and monocytes infiltrating sites of inflammation that happens in pulmonary hypertension [ 17 ]. No correlation was found between serum pentraxin 3 and hs-CRP as found in previous study [ 15 ]. To show the influence of pentraxin 3 and CRP on PAP as a dependent factor, we did linear regression analysis. This analysis showed that Pentraxin3 was the main sensitive biomarker of PAP than hs-CRP. This is similar to findings of Tamura et al., who added that hs-CRP is increased to a significant degree in the PAH group. This study also found that PAP was positively correlated with FS [ 15 ].
