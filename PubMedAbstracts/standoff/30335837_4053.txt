 Using human breast cancer patient data here we show that, C19MC miRNAs are the most tightly co-expressed miRNA set among all miRNAs that are expressed, and their high expression tightly correlates with basal-like TNBCs. A high CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein-β (CEBPBʰⁱᵍʰ) and low REST (RESTˡᵒʷ) expression profile positively correlates with C19MC expression and TNBCs. C19MC miRNA expression negatively correlates with PGR, ESR1 and ERBB2 mRNA expression and positively correlates with KRT5, KRT14 and KRT17 mRNA expression. C19MC miRNAs can target REST mRNA to potentially relieve the repressive effects of REST on C19MC or at CEBPB enhancer and can target PGR, ESR1, ERBB2, GATA3, SCUBE2, and TFF3 to contribute towards triple negative phenotype. Thus our study demonstrates that, a REST versus CEBPB plus C19MC miRNA expression marks TNBCs and that C19MC miRNAs plus CEBPB may potentially drive expression of key markers of TNBCs.
