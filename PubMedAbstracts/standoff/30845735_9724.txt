 It is well known that catecholamine overproduction has an adverse effect on cardiac structure [ 22 ]. Catecholamine stimulates cell growth and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which may lead to cardiac wall thickening and LV mass increase. In addition, in animal studies, catecholamine infusion has been shown to induce cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial interstitial fibrosis and scarring in both left and right ventricles [ 23 ]. In our previous studies, we found that the patients with PHEO displayed higher LVMI than patients with essential hypertension in echocardiography and that adrenalectomy led to a reduction of cardiovascular remodeling [ 11 ]. Catecholamine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, elevated cardiac wall thickness and collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix may explain the decrease in GLS in patients with PHEO in the current study. With a more contemporary tool, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, Ferreira at al. [ 24 ] demonstrated that patients with PHEO had broader extent of myocardial fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction than patients with EH and elevated LV mass, and cardiac fibrosis improved after the removal of catecholamine excess (after adrenalectomy). Taken together, these findings indicate that patients with PHEO had a more severe cardiac fibrosis. This reduction in GLS is well known from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in whom reductions in longitudinal strain may be found prior to the reduction in EF [ 12 ].
