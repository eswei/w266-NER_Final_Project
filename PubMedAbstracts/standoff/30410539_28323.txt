 We observed the gradual increase in IRS-4, pIGF-1 receptor, EGF receptor, procaspase 3 and PARP, according to the severity of the disease, as measured by the TNM system. Moreover, the procaspase 3 and caspase 3 levels were higher in T3/T4 group than in Tis/2 group. In a previous study, Roy et al. have shown that procaspase 3 and caspase 3 are overexpressed in human colon carcinoma [ 38 ] and very recently Zhou et al. have observed that caspase-3 regulates the migration, invasion, and metastasis of colon cancer cells [ 39 ]. In clinical studies, low levels of caspase 3 predict favourable response to 5FU-based chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer [ 40 ]. Conversely, higher amounts of activated caspase 3 in the tumour predict worse treatment outcomes in patients with CRC [ 31 ]. The mechanism involved in these findings may be related to the increase in the autocrine factor PGE2 by a caspase 3 dependent mechanism, which is able to stimulate cell regrowth and angiogenesis in different types of human cancers [ 31 , 32 , 40 ]. In fact, caspase 3 overexpression is associated with unfavourable outcome to therapy in melanoma [ 41 ], and to cytotoxic therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ 32 ] and in advanced breast cancer [ 32 ]. Our results, together with previous reports [ 42 ], suggest that in CRC tissue there is a general activation of the proteolytic enzymes. In fact, in tumoural tissue we observe a significant increase in the fragmentation of PARP, p53 and GSK-3. The first two are substrates of caspase 3 [ 43 , 44 ]; however, the third, to our knowledge, is not.
