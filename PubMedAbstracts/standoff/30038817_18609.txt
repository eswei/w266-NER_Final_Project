 Some studies have not shown a protective effect of uric acid and even proposed that it triggers the inflammatory process [ 25 ]. In a study on the correlation between uric acid and inflammation, inflammatory markers, IL-6, TNF-Î± (tumor necrosis factor alpha), and CRP were used. The authors reported a positive correlation between uric acid and these inflammatory markers [ 26 , 27 ]. The protective effect of uric acid against cancer has not been shown by all studies. One of these studies by Boffetta et al. monitored 16857 gout patients in the long term and investigated whether uric acid had a protective effect against cancer. Over the years of monitoring, the protective effect of uric acid against cancer was not observed in these patients [ 28 ]. Some studies have proposed that it triggers the development of cancer. A study by Kolonel et al. on this topic found a positive correlation between PCa and high uric acid levels. However, this study did not show a protective effect of uric acid against prostate cancer and at the same time the correlation with recurrence was not shown [ 16 ]. Another study by Sangkop et al. reported that uric acid initiated the pathway for prostate cancer progression. The authors proposed that the development of tolerance against factors inhibiting growth of cancer cells was important [ 29 ]. Another study by Fini et al. found that increased extracellular uric acid levels protected the cancer cells from oxidative compounds. Additionally they reported that uric acid was important for proliferation, migration and survival of tumor cells [ 30 ]. Hammarsten et al. proposed that high uric acid levels were a predictor of future development of PCa [ 31 ]. These results do not agree with the results of our study. The reason for this difference may be due to the different methods used as the standard in the studies.
