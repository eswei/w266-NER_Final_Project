 The present study also investigated how the expressions of these immune checkpoint proteins affected responses to NAC in breast cancer. Previous studies have shown that high, compared to low, PD-1 expression is associated with a poorer prognosis in malignant melanoma, RCC, and breast cancer [ 10 , 11 , 37 ]. Moreover, more reports about PD-L1 than about PD-1 suggest a correlation between PD-L1 expression and the degree of cancer malignancy and a poorer prognosis [ 12 , 14 – 16 ]. In TNBC, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression has been reported frequently in TNBC [ 1 , 12 ]. In the present study, patients with high PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions had significantly higher rates of TNBC. In addition, patients with low PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions had a significantly longer DFS. In particular, low PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions in TNBC were associated with a higher pCR rate and significantly longer DFS, and low PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor. These results suggest that immune escape mediated by immune checkpoints may play a role in the biological malignancy of TNBC. Among patients who received NAC, a longer DFS in patients with low PD-L1 expression suggests increased chemotherapy sensitivity. However, as limitation of this study, it is thought that pCR which has an influence on the prognosis of TNBC after NAC was included as a factor [ 38 , 39 ]. On the other hand, although HER2⁺BC showed correlation with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, there was no effect on prognosis.
