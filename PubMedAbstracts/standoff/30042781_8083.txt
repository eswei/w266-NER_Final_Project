 Materials and Methods Biological Materials and Growth Conditions Medicago truncatula R108 ecotype, the Tnt1-insertion mutants mtp2-1 (NF11171) and mtp2-2 (NF18305) were used in this study. Seeds were scarified in concentrated H₂SO₄ for 7 min and washed in dH₂O. Later, seeds were surface sterilized using 50% bleach for 90 s, washed in sterile dH₂O, and left overnight in sterile water to facilitate imbibition. After 48 h at 4°C, seeds were germinated in water-agar plates at 22°C for 48 h. Seedlings were then transplanted to sterilized perlite pots and inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti 2011, S. meliloti 2011 transformed with the GFP expressing pHC60 vector ( Cheng and Walker, 1998 ), or S. meliloti 1021 expressing pCMB13 DsRED ( Gage, 2002 ), as indicated. Plants were cultivated in a greenhouse in 16 h of light and 22°C conditions, and watered every 2 days with Jenner’s solution or water, alternatively ( Brito et al., 1994 ). This nutrient solution contained 5 mM CaSO₄, 1 mM KCl, 1 mM K₂HPO₄, 1 mM MgSO₄, 11.5 μM H₃BO₃, 7.3 μM Fe-citrate, 3.6 μM MnSO₄, 0.38 μM ZnSO₄, 0.16 mM CuSO₄, and 4 nM (NH₄)₆Mo₂O₂₄. Nodules were collected 28 dpi. Non-nodulated plants were watered every 2 weeks with solutions supplemented with 20 mM NH₄NO₃. For hairy-root transformations, M. truncatula seedlings were transformed with Agrobacterium rhizogenes ARqua1 carrying the appropriate binary vector as described ( Boisson-Dernier et al., 2001 ). Complementation assays were performed using the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains DY1457 (MATa ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3), the yeast double mutant zrc1cot1 (MATa ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 zrc1::his3 cot1::ura3) ( MacDiarmid et al., 2000 ), DY150 (MATa ade2-1 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc)), the mutant ccc1 (MATa ade2-1 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc) ccc1::his3; Li et al., 2001 ), BY4741 (his3 leu2 met1 ura3), and the strain Δsmf1 (his3 leu2 met1 ura3 Δsmf1; ThermoFisher). All strains were grown in synthetic dextrose (SD) medium ( Sherman et al., 1981 ) supplemented with necessary auxotrophic requirements, with 2% (w/v) glucose as the carbon source, and supplemented with Zn, iron, or manganese, when required.
