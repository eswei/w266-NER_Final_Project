 Aside from prematurity, genetic polymorphisms have been reported as an important factor in the development of SNNJ [ 4 – 6 ]. The most commonly-studied gene is the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) that is closely associated with Crigler-Najjar’s syndrome type I and II, and Gilberts syndrome. These conditions are frequently found in Caucasian and African populations [ 7 , 8 ]. Another gene that has been gaining attention, one that is mostly found in Asian populations, is OATP2/SLCO1B1 [ 9 ]. SLCO1B1 (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1b1) encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 and is responsible for the absorption of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin in the liver. This gene, located in chromosome 12p12, consists of 15 exons (1 coding exon and 1 non-coding exon) and 14 introns, as well as containing 2073 nucleotides in the gene-coding area [ 9 ]. Neonates carrying this gene polymorphism are associated with reduced bilirubin clearance which induces hyperbilirubinemia [ 10 ]. Rotor Syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease associated with elevated conjugated bilirubin, is an example of a disease frequently associated with mutations in SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. The most frequent polymorphisms found in this gene are SLCO1B1*1B (388A > G), SLCO1B1*4 (463C > A), and SLCO1B1*5 (521 T > C), and the most commonly associated with hyperbilirubinemia is the SLCO1B1*1B (388A > G) [ 9 , 11 – 13 ].
