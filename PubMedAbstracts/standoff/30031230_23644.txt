 Identification of proteins with prognostic value benefits the tumor classification. The dysregulation of HP1 proteins and their clinical significances have been documents in human cancers. Elevated expression of CBX3 was found in prostate cancer [14] , breast cancer [15] , lung cancer and colorectal cancer [16] . Overexpression of CBX3 was correlated with poor prognosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma [17] , non-small cell lung cancer [18] and prostate cancer [14] . Increased CBX5 expression was reported in prostate cancer [19] , [20] and breast cancer [15] . Furthermore, CBX1 was upregulated in prostate cancer [21] and breast cancer [12] . High expression of CBX1 transcript was associated with poor recurrence-free survival of patients with breast cancer [12] . On the other hand, CBX1 was reduced in thyroid carcinomas [22] . In the present study, CBX1 was markedly induced in HCC tissues. Patients with high CBX1 mRNA or protein expression survived shorter and experienced a shorter interval of tumor relapse or metastasis in two cohorts containing 648 patients. This might be attributed to high CBX1 expression was closely associated with larger tumor size, poor tumor differentiation and tumor vascular invasion. In addition, after adjusting for the prognostic factors established in the univariate analysis, a significant correlation between CBX1 expression and overall survival was confirmed. Collectively, these data indicate HP1 proteins as promising biomarkers for prediction of post-surgical prognosis of patients with malignances.
