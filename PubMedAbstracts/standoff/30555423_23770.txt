 In adrenals, our data demonstrated a significant decrease of AlaAP and CysAP in hypothyroid rats. These results of AlaAP may indicate a longer action of Ang III due to the reduction of its metabolism which could be linked to a greater release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland ( 21 ). In addition, the reduction of CysAP may indicate a longer action of arginine-vasopressin in the adrenals of hypothyroids. These results are in agreement with those reported by Yeum et al. ( 22 ) demonstrating an increase of aquaporins in hypothyroid rat kidney. Taken together, these results may explain in part the decreased diuresis observed in hypothyroidism ( 23 , 24 ). In the adrenals of hyperthyroid rats, our data suggest a longer action of Ang I and Ang II due to the decreased activity of GluAP and AspAP. In plasma, there was an increase of AlaAP in hypothyroids which suggests a higher formation of Ang IV than in euthyroid rats. There was also a higher plasma AlaAP activity in hyperthyroids accompanied by a decrease in CysAP. According to the reported effect of Ang IV on ATâ‚„ which reduces insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (CysAP) activity ( 7 ), these results suggest a higher formation of Ang IV which fits with the lower levels of CysAP and suggest a longer action of arginine-vasopressin in hyperthyroid subjects. These results are also in agreement with Mogulkoc and Baltaci ( 25 ) who reported increased plasma levels of arginine-vasopressin in rats with induced experimental hyperthyroidism.
