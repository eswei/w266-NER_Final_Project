 Glycodelin (gene name progesterone associated endometrial protein (PAEP)) has been well described during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy [ 8 , 9 ]. It has been shown to be expressed by the inner layers of the endometrium with high local concentrations and to act as an immunosuppressive protein [ 9 , 10 ]. Glycodelin expression during pregnancy has also been suggested to regulate the invasion deepness of the trophoblast and to be involved in successful implantation [ 11 ]. Beside its function during pregnancy and implantation, glycodelin has been shown to be overexpressed in hormone-related cancers, such as ovarian cancer [ 12 ] and breast cancer [ 13 ]. In part, contrary data has been published for endometrial cancer and breast cancer concerning prognostic influence and molecular functions of glycodelin [ 14 , 15 ]. In the last decade, increased glycodelin expression levels have also been described for hormone-independent malignancies as the malignant melanoma [ 16 ], non-small cell lung cancer [ 17 ] and the malignant pleural mesothelioma [ 18 ]. In 2015, we investigated the expression and function of glycodelin in a large surgical NSCLC cohort [ 17 ]. We observed that the gene was overexpressed in approximately 80% of all tumors. While PAEP was not expressed in normal lung tissue in half of the patients we examined, it was expressed up to 10,000 fold higher in tumor tissue. Moreover, we were able to detect glycodelin in the serum of approximately 40% of patients with NSCLC. Therefore, we suggested glycodelin as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for NSCLC.
