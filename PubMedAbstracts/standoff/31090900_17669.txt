 WGS characteristics of tumours with ‘non-BRCA1/2-like’ mutational signatures Twenty-five tumours were classified as ‘non-BRCA1/2-like’ and included 24 tumours from non-BRCA1/2 cases and a BRCA2-tumour (FBC016006, NM_000059.3, c.1310_1313delAAGA) that lacked somatic inactivation of the BRCA2 wild-type allele (supplementary Figure S9, available at Annals of Oncology online). Twenty-two tumours were ER/PR-positive; six were HER2-positive; and all were considered BRCA-proficient (Figure 3). Case FBC070169 had a strong APOBEC substitution signature accounting for 94% of the somatic mutations, yet there was no evidence of the APOBEC3A or APOBEC3B germline variants previously associated with this signature [ 15 , 16 ]. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering stratified the ‘non-BRCA1/2-like’ tumours into two groups based on the contributions of rearrangement signatures 1, 2 and 4 (Figures 3 and 4; supplementary Figure S10, available at Annals of Oncology online). Twelve tumours had either relatively quiet genomes dominated by rearrangement signature 2 (n = 9; with recurrent gain of 1q and/or loss of 16q) or rearrangement signature 1 (n = 3). The remaining thirteen tumours were younger at diagnosis (median age 44 versus 62 years) and displayed a high contribution of rearrangement signature 4, involving complex rearrangements clustered to one or a few chromosomes. These clustered events coincided with amplifications of known BC oncogenes (e.g. ZNF217, ERBB2, CCND1, MYC) [ 9 ], and in 8/13 tumours, the patterns of rearrangements suggested evidence for Breakage–Fusion–Bridge (BFB) cycles; two additional tumours had events resembling chromothripsis and BFB (Figure 4). We observed that ‘non-BRCA1/2-like’ tumours had shorter telomeres than BRCA-deficient tumours (supplementary Figure S11, available at Annals of Oncology online) raising the possibility that dicentric chromosome formation due to telomeric erosion could lead to BFB and/or chromothripsis [ 17 , 18 ]. We were unable to identify germline or somatic variants in candidate genes associated with chromosomal segregation or telomere maintenance that could potentially lead to this pattern of rearrangements. In four cases, however, we identified rare germline variants in TP53 (NM_000546.5: c.1009C>T), ATM (NM_000051.3: c.4909+1G>A) and CHEK2 (NM_007194.3: c.349A>G; NM_007194.3: c.1100delC), together with somatic loss of the wild-type allele, implying functional loss of the relevant protein (Figure 4). Figure 4. Whole-genome DNA copy number profile of non-BRCA1/2-like tumours. (A) Chromosome arm level copy number data [gains (red) and losses (blue)] across the genome in non-BRCA1/2-like tumours stratified according to rearrangement signatures 1, 2, and 4. Tumours are plotted in the same order as Figure 3. Tumours are identified which: harbour germline pathogenic variants in risk genes ATM, TP53 or CHEK2; show evidence of Break–Fusion–Bridge and/or chromothripsis; and harbour amplification of various oncogenes. (B) The distribution of histological grade was not significantly different (χ²). (C) Non-BRCA1/2-like tumours with a high proportion of rearrangement signature 4 (clustered rearrangements) were diagnosed at a significantly younger age to non-BRCA1/2 tumours with other genome characteristics (Mann -Whitney U test, two-tailed). (D) Circos plots are shown for the cases with germline variants in ATM, TP53 and CHEK2.
