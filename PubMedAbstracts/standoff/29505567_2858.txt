 Various genetic defects are known to cause the disease [ 5 – 7 ]. Among them, inactivating mutations in the PHEX (phosphate regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome, MIM 300550) lead to X-linked HR (XLHR, MIM 307800), the most common form of hereditary hypophosphatemia [ 8 ]. More than 424 different mutations have been listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, <url>, accessed on Jan 17, 2018). Gain-of-function mutations at codon R176 or R179 in the proteolytic cleavage domain of FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23, MIM 605380) cause autosomal dominant HR (ADHR, MIM 193100) [ 9 , 10 ]. Five different mutations are currently listed in the HGMD (accessed on Jan 17, 2018). Inactivating mutations in the DMP1 (dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1, MIM 600980) or ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1, MIM 173335) result in autosomal recessive HR type 1 (ARHR1, MIM 241520) [ 11 , 12 ] or autosomal recessive HR type 2 (ARHR2, MIM 613312) [ 13 ], respectively. The frequency of ARHR1 and ARHR2 is about the same. Currently, there are 9 different DMP1 and 8 ENPP1 mutations listed in the HGMD (accessed on Jan 17, 2018). Interestingly, ENPP1 mutations are more frequently reported in patients with idiopathic infantile arterial calcification or generalized arterial calcification of infancy (49 different mutations are listed in the HGMD), suggesting that a different pathway is involved in the generation of ARHR2 [ 14 ]. Inactivating mutations in the SLC34A1 (sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter 2a, MIM 182309) give rise to either autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis-1 (MIM 612286) [ 15 , 16 ] or Fanconi renotubular syndrome-2 (MIM 613388) [ 17 ], whereas a loss-of-function mutation in the SLC34A3 (sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter 2c, MIM 609826) results in hereditary HR with hypercalciuria (HHRH, MIM 241530) [ 18 , 19 ]. SLC34A1 mutation also causes autosomal-recessive infantile hypercalcemia-2 (HCINF2, MIM 616963) due to renal phosphate wasting-induced overproduction of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ [ 20 ]. Unlike inactivation mutation in CYP24A1 (MIM 126065) which causes infantile hypercalcemia-1 (HCINF1) [ 21 ], patients with HCINF2 respond rapidly to phosphate supplementation [ 20 ]. Currently, there are 25 different SLC34A1 and 33 SLC34A3 mutations listed in the HGMD (accessed on Jan 17, 2018). In addition, inactivating mutations in the CLCN5 (chloride voltage-gated channel 5, MIM 300008) lead to X-linked recessive HR (XLRHR, MIM 300554) and may be part of clinical presentations in Dent disease 1 (MIM 300009) characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal failure [ 22 – 24 ]. More than 250 different CLCN5 mutations are listed in the HGMD (accessed on Jan 17, 2018).
