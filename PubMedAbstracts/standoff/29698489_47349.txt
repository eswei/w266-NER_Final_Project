 Phenotypic overlap with other autophagy disorders The phenotype of AP-4 deficient mice and humans overlaps with that of other conditions caused by mutations in components of the autophagy machinery. Particularly relevant is the finding that mice with a brain-specific KO of ATG9A exhibit poor roratod performance, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and calbindin-positive spheroids in DCN [ 44 ], similarly to the AP-4 ε KO mice described here. These observations support the functional connection of AP-4 with ATG9A. Nevertheless, ATG9A KO is more deleterious than AP-4 ε or β4 KO, as ATG9A KO die embryonically or perinatally, depending on the mouse strain and whether the KO is general or CNS-specific [ 44 , 45 , 46 ]. Complete absence of ATG9A thus has a worse outcome than its retention at the TGN. This could be because the compensatory increase in ATG9A levels in AP-4 ε KO neurons allows for some ATG9A to reach pre-autophagosomal structures and thus maintain a certain level of autophagy in the absence of AP-4. Mutations in other autophagy proteins also cause some of the defects observed in AP-4-deficient humans and mice. For example, SPG49 is another form of complicated spastic paraplegia caused by mutation of the TECPR2 gene encoding an LC3B-interacting protein [ 47 ]. SPG49 patients also exhibit thin corpus callosum and neuroaxonal dystrophy [ 47 ]. Likewise, patients with Vici syndrome, a multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the autophagosome-lysosome tethering protein EPG5 [ 48 , 49 , 50 ], have callosal agenesis, developmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures [ 51 ]. EPG5 KO mice also show degeneration of corticospinal tracts [ 52 ]. Finally, KO of genes encoding the autophagy proteins ATG5 [ 41 ], ATG7 [ 42 ], RB1CC1 29] or WDR45 [ 53 ] in the mouse all cause motor and behavioral abnormalities, axonal swellings, accumulation of neuronal inclusion bodies and axonal degeneration. These observations highlight common features between AP-4 deficiency and primary autophagy disorders, suggesting related mechanisms of pathogenesis and supporting another alternative classification of AP-4 deficiency syndrome as a congenital disorder of autophagy [ 54 ].
