 Recent work showed lncRNA began to emerge as natural miRNA decoys. Although we have witnessed the discovery of numerous lncRNAs in the past two decades, only a small portion of them have been identified functionally, and very few of them have been validated to function as ceRNAs in cancers [ 25 ]. In PCa, the up-regulation of lncRNA GAS5 was reported to inactivate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway through targetting miR-103. HOTAIR can target HER2 mRNA by binding miR-331-3p and then modulates the depression of HER2 to promote the development of PCa [ 26 ]. In addition, lncRNA PVT1 was shown to promote EMT via suppressing miR-186 to activate Twist1 in PCa. UCA1 has been extensively reported as a miRNA sponge in various cancer. For example, Wu et al., showed that UCA1 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and migration through miRNA-193a/HMGB1 axis [ 27 ]. Moreover, UCA1 promotes mitochondrial function of bladder cancer via the miR-195/ARL2 signaling pathway [ 28 ]. In addition, UCA1 can interact with miR-182 to modulate glioma proliferation and migration by targetting iASPP [ 29 ]. In the present study, we used online prediction program to find candidate miRNAs, which reported previously as UCA1 target miRNA, in the 3â€²-UTR region of CXCR4. We identified miR-204 as potential miRNAs that links UCA1 and CXCR4. MiR-204 was demonstrated as tumor suppressor in various kind of cancer, and its functions involves cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion [ 30 , 31 ]. Therefore, UCA1 may function, in part, through inhibition of miR-204 in PCa.
