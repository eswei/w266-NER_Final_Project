 Mutational analysis From the 42 HAS patients, 24 patients with histologically typical cases were enrolled for NGS. Additionally, we randomly chose 22 clinical parameter-matched patients with common gastric adenocarcinoma (common gastric cancer; CGC) for NGS. The genetic alterations identified are summarized in supplementary Table 3. We next aimed to investigate the genomic differences between HAS and CGC patients sharing similar clinicopathologic parameters. Among the 24 HAS and 22 CGC sample sequencing results, 1 CGC sample was detected as microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) and 1 HAS and 3 CGC samples had insufficient DNA for analysis, leaving 23 and 18 patients in the HAS and CGC groups, respectively, for NGS analysis. The matched clinicopathological parameters of the two groups are summarized in Supplementary Table 4. Normal tissue adjacent to the tumour (NAT) is commonly used as a control in cancer studies [ 14 , 15 ], so we did so in our study. After filtering shared mutations found in both tumour tissue and NAT, we identified 167 mutations in 94 genes and 168 mutations in 101 genes in HAS and CGC tumour tissues, respectively. The most frequently mutated gene in both HAS and CGC tumour samples was TP53, consistent with previous reports and the TCGA database [ 10 , 16 ]. A total of 7 of the 23 (30.4%) HAS patients and 6 of the 18 (33.3%) CGC patients harboured TP53 mutations. In addition to TP53, CEBPA, RPTOR, WISP3, MARK1, and CD3EAP were detected as high-frequency mutations in HAS (10–20%). In contrast, NF2, C8orf34, NKX2-1, GPR124, FANCA, EPHA7, and CCND2 mutations were detected more frequently in CGC (10–20%). The frequencies of the mutation sites are listed in Table 1.
