 PPHN is a subgroup of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is a complex disorder characterized by elevation of PVR and failure of right heart function. It is a common complication of many clinical diseases. PAH is classified into five types according to the pathogenesis of the disease (WHO classification) and PPHN is a specific group [ 7 ]. Pathogenic variants among several genes have been reported in PAH patients exhibiting both adulthood onset and childhood onset. Bone morphogenic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2), a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) superfamily, is associated with 70% of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH)/heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH) cases and 20% of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH) cases [ 8 ]. SMAD9 [ 9 ], CAV1 [ 10 ], KCNK3 [ 11 ] are also known PAH genes listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) gene variants in the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) [ 12 ] and endoglin (ENG) [ 13 ] have been identified in PAH patients. To date, no causal genes for PPHN have been reported, and the genetic etiology remains unclear. We suggest that the genetic pathogenesis of PPHN may share some similarities with PAH in adults and children.
