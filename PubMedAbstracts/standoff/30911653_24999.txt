 TGF-β, ROS and Redox fibrosis ROS are formed by mitochondrial metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, ischaemia/reperfusion injury or exposure to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, chemotherapy or asbestos [ 34 ]. ROS activate expression of TGF-β1, and activated TGF-β1 also increases ROS production. Activation of TGF-β1 by ROS appears to be direct, as release of recombinant latent TGF-β1 can occur in the absence of cellular machinery by ionizing radiation or by metal ion-catalysed ascorbate reactions. Activation of TGF-β by ROS only occurs with TGF-β1 and not TGF-β2 or TGF-β3. This is related to ROS oxidation of the LAP-beta1 protein at methionine253 [ 35 ]. The selective activation of TGF-β1 suggests specific DAMPs signalling for different latent TGF-β family members. Increased ROS production by activated TGF-β1 is mainly due to induction of NADPH oxidases (NOX). TGF-β1-induced NOX 4 expression is associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and hepatic fibrosis. TGF-β1 upregulates NOX4 expression and the NOX4-dependent generation of hydrogen peroxide, which is required for TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation, ECM production and contractility [ 35 ]. Furthermore, TGF-β1 decreases antioxidant enzyme activity including Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1), SOD2, Glutathione (GSH) peroxidase, GSH and Catalase (CTL). These are particularly involved in the suppression of Fenton reaction generation of hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide [ 35 ]. The persistent activation of LTGF-β1 by oxidative stress and TGF-β1-mediated nett persistence of ROS may represent a ROS/TGF-β1 positive feedback loop, leading to amplification of cellular damage, carcinogenesis and fibrosis [ 34 ]. Such disturbance in ROS generation and scavenging is referred to as “redox-fibrosis” [ 35 ].
