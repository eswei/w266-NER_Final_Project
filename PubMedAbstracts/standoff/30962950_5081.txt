 In the present study, our previous method was used to screen for HCC recurrence-related N-linked glycoproteins in the serum of HCC patients. A major challenge in the treatment of HCC is the identification of patients who are at a greater risk for tumor recurrence after treatment, particularly for patients with early stage disease who do not show significant vascular invasion, regional lymph node, or distant metastasis ²¹ . We screened serum samples, and identified a potential recurrence-related N-linked glycoprotein from HCC patients with BCLC 0 or A stage disease (cohort A). Serum core-fucosylated quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (cf-QSOX1) was found to be significantly associated with postoperative recurrence of HCC, and serum QSOX1 was shown to be completely represented by the 67 kDa short isoform of QSOX1 (QSOX1-S). We further validated the prognostic significance of QSOX1 in tumor tissues for HCC patients after curative resection. A significant positive correlation was found between serum cf-QSOX1 and tumor expressed QSOX1. The functional roles of QSOX1-S and its glycosylation in HCC metastasis were further investigated. We show that QSOX1-S expression can inhibit HCC tumor invasion and metastasis. Glycosylation at residue Asn-130 was further shown to be required for the inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of HCC. A flowchart of experimental plan is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1.
