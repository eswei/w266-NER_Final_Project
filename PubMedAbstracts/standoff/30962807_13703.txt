 Currently, HbA1C is the “gold standard” for identifying the overall blood glucose control; however, 1,5-AG which can reflect rapid changes in glycemia is more accurate than HbA1C [ 32 ]. Therefore, 1,5-AG as a blood glucose marker can provide complementary information to HbA1C. Moreover, in our previous observation, we demonstrated that serum 1,5-AG is a sensitive and specific glycemic control marker and can identify diabetes in populations [ 33 ]. However, unlike HbA1c, multiple factors such as diet and renal function may limit the comparison of 1,5-AG levels between individuals. Some researchers reported that 1,5-AG cannot be used to predicate blood glucose in patients that suffer from impaired renal function [ 34 ]. In the present study, the subjects were classified into different groups by eGFR, and we found that 1,5-AG was still negatively associated with HbA1c in T2DM subjects with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Considering these results, we conclude that 1,5-AG remain a reliable glycemic control marker even if patients suffer mild or moderate renal dysfunction, which is consistent with a previous observation [ 35 ]. In addition, in the current study, we showed that serum 1,5-AG levels were not influenced by eGFR, whereas a previous study reported that 1,5-AG was negatively correlated with kidney function, which might be owing to an age-associated decrease in the renal glucose threshold [ 28 ].
