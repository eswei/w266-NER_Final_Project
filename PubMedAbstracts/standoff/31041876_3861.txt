 Previous genetic studies have implicated voltage-gated sodium channels (Naᵥs) in neuropathic pain syndromes associated with peripheral neuropathies. ⁷ Classically, gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene that encodes the Naᵥ1.7 sodium channel isoform, are known to cause inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), ⁸ – ¹² paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), ¹³ – ¹⁵ and other painful pain disorders including small-fiber neuropathy (SFN), ¹⁶ whereas loss-of-function mutations in this gene result in congenital insensitivity to pain. ¹⁷ – ¹⁹ However, other sodium channel isoforms have more recently been implicated in neuropathic pain states. ²⁰ – ²⁶ Naᵥ1.6 knockdown ameliorates mechanical allodynia after spared nerve injury, ²¹ and a gain-of-function Naᵥ1.6 mutation has been linked to trigeminal neuralgia. ²⁰ Gain-of-function mutations in Naᵥ1.8 were reported in three patients with painful peripheral neuropathies. ²² Further evidence has since followed linking Naᵥ1.8 mutations to SFN. ²⁴ , ²⁷ Like Naᵥ1.7 and −1.8, mutations in Naᵥ1.9 have been reported in patients with painful peripheral neuropathies. ²³ , ²⁵ , ²⁸ Although the contribution of these Naᵥs to painful neuropathies has been thoroughly investigated, no human data to date have shown a role of the β-subunits.
