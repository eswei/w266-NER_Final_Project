 Lysyl oxidase (LOX) and its family members LOX-like (LOXL) 1–4 are copper-dependent amine oxidases that catalyze the covalent crosslinking of collagen and elastin, resulting in increased ECM stiffness. The aberrant expression of LOX family oxidases and/or deregulated oxidase activity is responsible for the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer. 12 , 13 Among the LOX family members, LOXL2 has been deemed an important regulator of tumor progression. 14 Early studies on breast cancers demonstrated that LOXL2 overexpression induced the formation of fibrotic foci within tumors with invasive properties 15 and that increased LOXL2 expression promoted the invasiveness of breast cancer cells and induced EMT. 15 – 17 In addition, increased LOXL2 expression was reported to be associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in head and neck, lung, breast, stomach, and esophageal cancers. 18 – 20 Moreover, LOXL2-specific antibody was found to be effective in both primary and metastatic xenograft models of breast cancer. 21 In HCCs, Wong et al. 22 demonstrated that only LOXL2, among the LOX family members, was substantially overexpressed in human HCC tissues, when compared to non-tumoral liver tissues, and it was up-regulated by hypoxia and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. In addition, they showed that LOXL2 promoted intrahepatic metastasis by increasing tissue stiffness and facilitated extrahepatic metastasis by enhancing recruitment of bone-marrow-derived cells to metastatic sites. 22 Therefore, LOXL2 is likely to contribute to HCC progression, especially under the hypoxic and inflammatory microenvironment, and may be a potential therapeutic target. However, the clinicopathologic relevance of LOXL2 expression in human HCC tissues remains unclear.
