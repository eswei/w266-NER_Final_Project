 To our knowledge, three cases of MPO-ANCA-related SNHL induced by PTU have been reported ( 15 - 17 ); however, the concept of OMAAV associated with the administration of PTU has been hardly recognized so far. Regarding other drug-induced AAVs, hydralazine was found to be associated with ENT involvement ( 18 ), and one case report described atorvastatin-induced hearing loss and tinnitus ( 19 ). However, whether or not these inducible drugs affect the development of OMAAV is unclear. According to previous clinical studies, PTU-induced MPO-ANCA does not always induce symptomatic vasculitis, and mild involvements, such as arthralgia, myalgia, and cutaneous lesions, are common characteristics of PTU-induced AAV ( 11 , 12 , 20 - 22 ). Furthermore, a comparative study demonstrated that ear manifestations appear less frequently in patients with PTU-induced AAV than in those with primary AAV ( 22 ). However, the present case suggested that PTU could also induce OMAAV. Furthermore, trigeminal neuropathy was also shown in this patient. Only one other case of trigeminal neuropathy related to OMAAV has been reported ( 23 ), with HP and facial nerve palsy being more common complications and recognized as prognostic factors in OMAAV ( 7 , 9 ). In patients with GPA, cranial nerve involvements are commonly complicated, and trigeminal neuropathy can also be found ( 24 ). However, cranial nerve manifestations are significantly less frequent in PTU-induced AAV than in primary AAV ( 22 ); furthermore, it has never been shown that trigeminal neuropathy is specific to PTU-induced AAV. Therefore, the appearance of trigeminal neuropathy may be a possible complication in OMAAV.
