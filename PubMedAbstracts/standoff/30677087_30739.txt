 In the present study, the low serum 25(OH)D concentration was also shown to be related to increased prevalence for both myopia and high myopia, which is consistent with previous studies using the KNHANES data [ 21 , 31 ]. Other researchers also revealed that myopes had a significantly lower blood vitamin D concentration compared with non-myopes [ 4 , 45 ], A large population-based study revealed that polymorphisms within vitamin D receptor (VDR) are related to a low-to-moderate degree of myopia [ 46 ]. As endogenous synthesis of vitamin D is induced by sunlight, it is often considered a biomarker of outdoor activity [ 46 ]. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency has been increasing worldwide [ 47 , 48 ]. Data from KNHANES also showed that vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in Korean adolescents [ 49 ], which can be explained by reduced sunlight exposure caused by high educational pressure and decreased intake of vitamin D-rich foods [ 49 , 50 ]. Given that vitamin D plays an important role in the intestinal absorption of calcium, mineral homeostasis, and bone growth in adolescence [ 51 ], it can be hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with the development of myopia in adolescence [ 51 ]. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency can also result in the impairment of relaxation and contraction of the ciliary muscles caused by an alteration of intracellular calcium concentration, which may lead to myopia genesis [ 52 ]. Moreover, vitamin D initiates the formation of the VDR/retinoic acid heterodimer [ 53 ], which participates in the retinoscleral signal pathway that may influence myopic ocular growth [ 21 ]. The major product of novel cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1)-initiated pathway of vitamin D₃ metabolism, 20-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (20(OH)D₃), and its metabolites may have anti-proliferative, pro-differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects, which could prevent myopia [ 54 – 56 ].
