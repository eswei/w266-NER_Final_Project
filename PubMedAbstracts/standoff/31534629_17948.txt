 Overall these data show that the PSA expression level in prostate cancer cells is one of the strongest prognostic features in this tumor entity. This is not only demonstrated by the independent prognostic value of PSA staining in several models but also by its strong prognostic impact in PTEN deleted cancers. PTEN deletion is another highly prognostic feature, which has recently been recommended for measurement in routine praxis by several authors [ 19 – 22 ]. Most prognostic biomarkers lose their prognostic impact in the subgroup of PTEN deleted cancers which already are characterized by a poor prognosis [ 23 , 24 ]. The reason for higher tumor aggressiveness in cancers with reduced PSA expression is unclear. Some authors have suggested a tumor protective role of PSA. For example, Heidtmann et al. showed that PSA exerts antiangiogenic properties by converting Lys-plasminogen to biologically active angiostatin-like fragments [ 25 ]. Gkika et al. found that PSA reduces motility of PC-3 prostate cancer cells through stimulation of a particular ion channel at the plasma membrane [ 26 ]. Bindukumar et al. reported that PSA treatment modulated the expression of growth factors and suppressed the growth of prostate tumor xenografts in mice [ 27 ]. However, PSA production may be one of the most important functions of normal prostate glandular cells. One can thus speculate, that a measurable deficiency in this function might represent a subtle sign of cellular dedifferentiation. Normal prostatic glands exhibit a particular strong PSA staining at the apical cell border. That a loss of this physiological apical predominance of PSA staining is directly linked to poor prognosis, irrespective of the perceived overall staining intensity, is consistent with altered PSA representing “dedifferentiation”.
