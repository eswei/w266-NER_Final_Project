 To gain further insight into the potential for F10 to replace 5-FU for the treatment of CRC, we have undertaken a study investigating the relative potency of F10 and 5-FU towards four isogenic human CRC cell lines derived from HCT-116 but that differ in TP53 mutational status[ ²¹ ]. HCT-116 is a cellular model of KRAS-mutant[ ²⁷ ], MSI+ CRC[ ²⁸ ] and is considered relatively 5-FU-resistant[ ²⁹ ]. HCT-116 is p53 wild-type and variants that are p53−/− or that express the p53 GOF mutation R248W on one allele with the second allele either expressing WT p53 (R248W/+) or being inactivated (R248W/−) were previously developed[ ²¹ ]. The R248W mutation affects the DNA binding surface of p53[ ³⁰ ] and HCT-116 R248W/− display reduced induction of p53 relative to WT cells while induction of p21 is absent in 5-FU-treated R248W/− cells[ ²¹ ]. Our studies show that F10 is a true DNA-directed FP[ ³¹ ] with efficient rescue only by exogenous Thy[ ³² ], but not Urd. Further, F10 is considerably more potent than 5-FU to all CRC cells tested regardless of p53 mutations. The largest resistance factor (~8-fold) occurred for both 5-FU and F10 towards HCT-116 R248W/− cells indicating GOF mutations of this class confer resistance broadly to FP drugs. However, even these cells remained sensitive to F10 at sub-micromolar concentrations that are likely therapeutically achievable while the IC₅₀ for 5-FU towards these cells was 69.5 ± 12.8 μmol/L, consistent with CRC tumors with this genotype being resistant to treatment with 5-FU. Our studies indicate F10 and other polymeric FPs are likely to be effective for treatment of CRC regardless of TP53 mutational status.
