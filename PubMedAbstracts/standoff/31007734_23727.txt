 RAB22A is a member of the RAS oncogene family that is amplified or expressed in specific tumors, including lung cancer, melanoma and osteosarcoma ( 32 â€“ 34 ). Rabs serves as master regulator of transport between membrane compartments within cells, recruiting multiple effector molecules that recognize cargo, promote membrane fission and fusion, alter lipid composition, mediate transport along cytoskeletal elements and regulate other Rabs. ( 35 , 36 ). RAB22A is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma ( 37 ). Furthermore, overexpression of RAB22A causes a prominent morphological enlargement of early and late endosomes, but hampers the transport between endosomes and the Golgi apparatus ( 38 , 39 ). RAB22A is associated with the co-localization of auto phagosomes, which is associated with another mechanism that leads to excessive RAB22A activation in tumor cells, including the interaction with early endosome antigen 1 and membrane transport ( 40 ). Previous research has indicated that RAB22A depletion may activate the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK signaling pathway, eventually leading to the occurrence of tumor development ( 41 ). The present study indicated that miR-193b targeted RAB22A through the Ras signaling pathway, resulting in the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, repression of downstream factors and the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and other biological functions.
