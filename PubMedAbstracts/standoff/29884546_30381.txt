 The role of Kupffer cells, as well as Kupffer cell-specific TLR4, in the development of alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation is unclear. Järveläinen et al. showed that Kupffer cell inactivation did not alleviate alcohol-induced inflammatory responses in rat liver [45] . However, other studies have found that loss of Kupffer cells reduced hepatic pathological scores, including inflammation and necrosis, after intragastric alcohol infusions [44] , [46] . Using bone marrow transplantation technique, Inokuchi et al. reported that TLR4 expressing-bone marrow cells contribute to alcohol-induced hepatic mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-1β [10] . In our model, alcohol-fed mice with myeloid cell TLR4 deficiency showed reduced expression of Tnfα and CD11c, as well as significantly elevated IL-6 expression in the liver. Importantly, mice lacking IL-6 are more susceptible to ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis [52] , [53] , [54] . Furthermore, IL-6 treatment in vivo alleviates liver injury in alcohol-fed mice [55] . Taken together, these hepatic alterations in alcohol-fed Tlr4ΔᵐΦ mice could play a protective role in reducing liver damage and potentially decreasing circulating inflammatory cytokines.
