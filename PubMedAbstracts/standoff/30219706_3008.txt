 Among the important mediators of glioblastoma cell invasion is TROY, an orphan member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which is widely expressed during embryonic development but whose postnatal expression is tightly regulated [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] . Increased expression of TROY has been implicated in several invasive cancers, including melanoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and GBM [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . We have previously shown that expression of TROY protein is low in non-neoplastic brain tissue but increases with glial tumor grade and inversely correlates with patient survival [13] . We also noted that TROY mRNA expression was elevated in invasive glioma cells relative to cells in the matched tumor core [14] . Increased expression of TROY stimulated glioma cell invasion in vitro and invasion ex vivo in brain slices, and induced astrocyte migration in situ. TROY-stimulated migration correlated with increased glioma cell resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) or radiation in vitro via activation of Akt and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) [14] . Conversely, knockdown of TROY expression inhibited glioma cell migration and increased sensitivity to TMZ [14] . Furthermore, knockdown of TROY expression alone significantly increased survival in an intracranial xenograft model [14] . Recently, we found that TROY forms a novel complex with epidermal growth factor receptor and that TROY was capable of modulating epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in GBM [15] . However, the signaling pathways and specific downstream effectors involved in TROY-stimulated cell migration and invasion remain largely undefined.
