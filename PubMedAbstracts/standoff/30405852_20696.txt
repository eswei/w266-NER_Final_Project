 Oestrogens promote cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis in breast cancer by binding to ERs 43 . Tumour angiogenesis is essential in tumour metastasis 24 , and VEGF is an important potential proangiogenic factor that is involved in breast cancer angiogenesis 44 . As previously mentioned 2 , breast cancer is divided into hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer and TNBC. Studies have suggested that ERα, which is activated by oestrogen, increases VEGF levels in ER-positive breast cancer through binding to VEGF- related oestrogen response elements 28 . Similarly, E2 promotes VEGF expression and angiogenesis via GPER-1 together with the EGFR/ERK/c-FOS signalling pathway in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer 35 . However, another study found that E2 treatment inhibited tumour formation in ERβ-expressing TNBC cell lines through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 7 12 . Transfection of the androgen receptor-positive TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs5787 with ERβ1 also resulted in fewer pulmonary metastases in vivo compared with empty vector-transfected cells through inhibition of ZEB1 45 . In addition, treatment with the GPER-1-specific agonist G-1 can suppress cell migration and tumour angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through NF-kB/IL-6 in TNBC 37 . The above studies suggest that activation of ERβ or GPER-1 by oestrogens may potentially inhibit TNBC progression. Our findings also suggest that E2 inhibits VEGF expression in a concentration- and time- dependent manner and GPER-1 might be involved in the E2-induced suppression of angiogenesis in TNBC cell lines. Additionally, E2 also repressed tumour growth and angiogenesis in MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumours in vivo. Overall, the complexity of the function of E2 and GPER-1 might be due to differences in breast cancer subtypes, cell types, agonist specificity, receptor expression ratios and the activation of signalling molecules.
