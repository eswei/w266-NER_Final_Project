 As the results showed in the multiple stepwise regression analysis, eGFR, a good indicator for evaluation of renal injury, was another important influencing factor of TCSS in addition to duration and genomic DNA methylation. Diabetic renal injury and neuropathy have many of the same pathological mechanisms, such as small vessel disease and inflammation [ 24 ]. So it was commonly found in clinical practice that the incidence of DPN in patients with diabetic renal injury is high [ 25 ] and the low level eGFR is closely associated with DPN [ 19 ]. Furthermore, it was reported that aberrant DNA methylation in the proximal tubules was related to diabetic nephropathy [ 26 ]. Then, we need to know if genomic DNA methylation is a specific risk factor for DPN, or just a contributing factor to all the chronic complications of diabetes. We divided the population into the nonrenal injury group and renal injury group and compared the levels of genomic DNA methylation between the two groups. The results showed that the levels of genomic DNA methylation did not alter significantly in the renal injury group, when compared to the nonrenal injury group. From the results, we consider that genomic DNA methylation is a relative specific risk factor of DPN. Regrettably, retinopathy, the classic diabetic microangiopathy, was not accounted in the present study due to conditional restrictions.
