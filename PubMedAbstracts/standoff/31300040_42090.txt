 Atherosclerosis contributes significantly to coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the developed world [ 29 ]. It is the combined consequence of chronic VI and lipid metabolism dysfunction, characterized by abnormally elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. Sub-endothelial retention of LDL, particularly oxLDL, is an initiating event in atherogenesis [ 30 ] and a contributing factor in plaque development [ 30 ]. However, combating rising LDL levels alone with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has failed to completely eliminate MACE events due to atherosclerosis [ 31 ]. Despite LDL management, approximately 1/3 of all CVD patients on statins still experience cardiovascular events due to residual inflammation [ 32 ]. Compounds that inhibit hyper-inflammatory signaling or block leukocyte-endothelial interactions are now being developed to combat residual inflammatory risk in atherosclerosis. For instance, direct suppression of inflammation with an interleukin IL-1Î² monoclonal antibody (canakinumab) reduced the relative risk of MACE by 15% in CVD patients over 3.7 years [ 33 ]. The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) has demonstrated that inflammation is another viable therapeutic target for the prevention of CVD-related events. The BD2-selective BETi apabetalone has also been shown to significantly reduce the relative risk of MACE. This may be attributed to its suppression of inflammatory gene expression and transcription of genes key to atherogenesis. These genes contribute to monocyte activation and recruitment, leukocyte capture, rolling, adhesion, firm adhesion, macrophage differentiation, plaque development, and stability (Fig. 1).
