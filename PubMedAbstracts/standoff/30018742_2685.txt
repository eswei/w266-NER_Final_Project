 Clinically, breast cancers are categorised into three groups including oestrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 amplified, and Triple Negatives (TNBC, lacking expression of ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2) [ 7 ]. Around 25-30% of breast cancers harbour a somatic mutation in the TP53 gene [ 8 ]. Prevalence of TP53 mutations is subtype dependent and are more frequent in TNBCs compared to other subtypes [ 7 , 9 ]. In general, breast cancers with TP53 mutations are known to have a poor clinical outcome [ 7 , 9 ]. In addition to mutations, expression of TP53 isoforms and other family members have been associated with poor patient outcome. Examples include: (1) elevated levels of Δ40TP53 RNA in TNBCs [ 10 ]; (2) elevated levels of Δ133TP53 RNA in other breast cancers [ 11 ]; and (3) elevated ΔNTP63 RNA levels in high risk breast cancers [ 12 ]. Additionally it has been shown that Δ133p53 promotes invasion of breast cancer cell lines [ 11 ] and ΔNp63 promotes a cancer stem-like cell in TNBCs [ 12 ]. Conversely TAp63 suppresses metastasis in breast cancer [ 13 ] and loss of TAp73 or upregulation of ΔNp73 has been associated with increased angiogenesis in breast cancer [ 14 ]. This complex transcriptional pattern and potential interplay among TP53 family members makes translating TP53 mutation status into clinical utility difficult.
