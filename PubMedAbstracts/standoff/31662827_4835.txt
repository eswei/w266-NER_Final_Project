 A recent study reported that the level of acylcarnitine in steatohepatitis (SH) patients with HCC was increased compared with that reported in SH patients without HCC[ 6 ]. In addition, CPT2 was downregulated in SH patients with HCC[ 6 , 7 ]. Hence, a high level of acylcarnitine may serve as a useful biomarker for the early diagnosis of HCC in SH patients. Consequently, a high level of acylcarnitine has been linked to the development of HCC in SH patients. In contrast, another study reported that the level of acetylcarnitine (AC2) - one of the acylcarnitine species - was decreased in non-SH patients with HCC vs those without HCC, the level of AC2 was associated with tumor stage, and the expression of AC2 in HCC tissue was decreased according to tumor stage[ 8 ]. In addition, CPT1 was shown to be downregulated in non-SH patients with HCC[ 8 , 9 ]. Therefore, a low level of AC2 has been associated with the development of HCC. Furthermore, a recent study reported that AC2 significantly downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)[ 10 ]. Thus, it was suggested that AC2 possesses anti-angiogenic properties through the VEGF and CXCL12 pathways.
