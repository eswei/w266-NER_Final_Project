 The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of AML have been widely acknowledged and integrated to optimize the prediction of clinical outcomes for AML patients. Previous studies demonstrated that FLT3‐ITD, TP53, RUNX1, ASXL1 aberrations, and KMT2A rearrangements are associated with adverse prognosis, while patients with biCEBPA mutations, RUNX1‐RUNXT1T1, and CBFβ‐MYH11 seem to have a relatively good outcome.10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 However, our knowledge concerning distribution and prognostic significance of gene alterations in e/s‐AML patients remains scarce. Our study indicated that elderly and secondary patients carried more inferior molecular events such as KMT2A‐AF9 and DNMT3A mutations and less favorable ones including RUNX1‐RUNXT1T1, CBFβ‐MYH11, and biallelic CEBPA. Furthermore, genetic aberrations including NRAS, DNMT3A, IDH1 mutations, and CBFβ‐MYH11 conveyed prognostic information independently in e‐AML or s‐AML patients. However, some significant genetic alterations such as TP53, TET2, ASXL1, and RUNX1 mutations were not routinely tested in our center and accordingly not available in this retrospective study. Tsai et al22 reported that the e‐AML harbored more mutations concerning PTPN11, NPM1, RUNX1, ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, and TP53 genes, but had less WT1 mutations. In addition, DNMT3A and TP53 mutations were independent adverse prognostic factors for elderly patients. Other studies10, 23, 24, 25 showed epigenetic modifier genes (EMGs) including DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2 were more frequent in e‐AML patients, which was thought to be associated with age‐related clonal hematopoiesis and inferior survival. S‐AML patients were reported to carry less NPM1 mutations and FLT3‐ITD.26, 27 Besides, patients with AML secondary to MDS and CMML carried more ASXL1 and NRAS mutations.27 Currently, a prospective study including more molecular events is performed in our center, which will provide more integrated results concerning the distribution and prognostic significance of molecular alterations in e/s‐AML patients.
