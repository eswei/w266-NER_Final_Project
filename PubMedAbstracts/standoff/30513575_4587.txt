 Activation of the MAPK cascade via mutations and/or rearrangements of genes REarranged during Transfection (RET), Rat sarcoma (RAS), and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF) occurs in ~70% of well-differentiated TCs. Among these abnormalities, BRAF is the most frequently mutated gene in TC, and a predictor of poor clinical prognosis and recurrence [ 14 ]. TC also shows mutations in PI3-K signaling effectors, such as Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) [ 15 ]. The PI3-K pathway may also be over-activated in TC by non-mutational mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the IGF system. In fact, we have previously demonstrated that both IGFs are locally produced in TCs: IGF-1 by stromal cells and IGF-2 by malignant thyrocytes, with higher values in malignant tissues compared to normal tissue [ 16 ]. In addition, IGF-1R and IR have been found to be overexpressed, especially in PDTCs. As a consequence of this overexpression, IR/IGF-1R hybrid formation and increased IGF-1 response occur. Another important finding is that overexpressed IR is predominantly present as the fetal IR-A isoform, and that malignant thyrocytes acquire the ability to produce IGF-2. This autocrine loop involving IGF-2 and the isoform IR-A is activated in different cancers and particularly in the PDTC histotypes [ 16 , 17 , 18 ], and exerts a crucial role in regulating stem-like properties, metastases, and resistance to therapies [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ]. Indeed, IR-A, IGF-1R, and their ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2 are overexpressed in human thyroid progenitor cells, with a prevalence in progenitors from TC cells, where IGF-2 exerts a role in stimulating self-renewal and thyrosphere volume [ 20 ]. Furthermore, besides the formation of IR/IGF-1R hybrid receptors, the functional crosstalk between IR-A and other tyrosine kinase receptors such as the non-integrin collagen receptor, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), the receptor for the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) Met, and other still unknown partners might add more complexity to the contribution of IR-A in TC pathogenesis.
