 Anti‐cancer effectiveness of FAK inhibitors could be arrested by compensatory EGFR‐related signaling FAK is overexpressed in 80% of all solid tumors and FAK inhibitors have been considered as promising anti‐cancer drugs (Weiner et al., 1993; Owens et al., 1995; Lark et al., 2003). However, anti‐cancer clinical trials of FAK inhibitors show the limited single‐agent efficacy (Gan et al., 2012; Infante et al., 2012) and compensatory signaling has been found to be responsible for this phenomenon. In the study performed by Marlowe et al., the results confirmed that the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) predicted patient response to FAK‐kinase inhibitors. FAK‐kinase inhibition induced RTK activation in RTK high cancer cells while the selective pressure of FAK‐kinase inhibition was able to drive RTK low triple‐negative breast cancer cells to express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The inhibition of FAK induced compensatory increases of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), pHER2, pAKT, and phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated protein kinase (pERK). Moreover, FAK inhibition led to a paradoxical increase of phosphorylated FAK tyrosine 397 (FAK pY397), which could maintain FAK‐dependent cancer cell migration and invasion. HER2 (and potentially other RTKs) was found to bind to FAK FERM F1 lobe and promoted its proximity to FAK Y397, allowing HER2 to directly phosphorylate FAK Y397 (Marlowe et al., 2016). In addition, E‐cadherin has been reported to arrest FAK inhibitor‐induced apoptosis and support merlin‐negative malignant mesothelioma progression (Kato et al., 2017). ALDH1A3, CD44, and MDR1 were found to play a role in the cancer cell resistance to FAK autophosphorylation inhibitor Y15 and their downregulation would sensitize resistant cancer cells to Y15 (Golubovskaya et al., 2015).
