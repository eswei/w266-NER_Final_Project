 While there is growing evidence with regard to OPN playing a crucial role in metabolic disorders, particularly focusing on NAFLD and obesity, data on OPN and LFC in PCOS are rather limited. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the increased circulating OPN levels associated with a high degree of LFC in non-obese PCOS women. In line with a previous study, despite differences in BMI of the patient cohorts, OPN was observed to be correlated with several metabolic parameters such as BMI, WHR (waist circumference in a previous study), glucose and insulin levels, HOMA-IR, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and hsCRP [ 34 ]. Moreover, PCOS patients with OPN levels in the third quartile showed a 2.82 times greater LFC than those in the PCOS group with OPN levels in the lowest quartile (18.58% vs 6.6%). Interestingly, compared to those in the second and third quartiles, subjects with OPN levels in the highest quartile had a lower LFC. Since OPN is elevated in the progression of simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis [ 34 ], the change in LFC levels may account for this decline in OPN. In this study, we excluded fibrosis using the BMI, age, ALT and triglycerides (BAAT) index because of the relatively low BMI and age in this cohort. In addition, a stepwise linear regression analysis showed that the serum OPN level is a predictor of LFC independent of TG, HOMA-IR and FAI, indicating that the effect of changes in OPN levels on the metabolic phenotype of PCOS may be the result of a mechanism that is independent of insulin sensitivity.
