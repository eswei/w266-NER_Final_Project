 APOB is one of the major genes used for the molecular diagnosis of FH. The chromosomal region is located in the 2p24.1 region.[ ²¹ ]APOB was initially discovered in 1987 in phenotypic patients with FH, which revealed that FH is not related to mutations in LDLR.[ ²² ]ApoB has a specific role in FH disease, and variants in APOB typically occur in the exons. Patients with FH with a familial deficiency in APOB may have a milder form of the disease, which can affect LDLR mutations.[ ²³ ]APOB is known to be associated with FH and it very important in the diagnosis of FH disease. Patients with homozygous FH may be documented in a proband with the appearance of biallelic pathogenic variants.[ ²⁴ ] This gene encodes 2 proteins (ApoB-48 and ApoB-100), which play a major role in disease diagnosis. ApoB-48 is present in the intestine and ApoB-100 is in the liver. FH disease with APOB is confirmed by documenting 5 known mutations in ApoB-100. Each mutation blocks cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries, increasing cholesterol levels and thus the risk of heart attack. Each mutation modifies a single protein building block in a critical region of ApoB-100. LDLs are removed from the blood by the modified proteins, leading to increased cholesterol levels. This is the major relationship between FH and APOB.[ ²⁵ ] In any population, patients with mutations in Val2095Glu may have a greater risk of developing FH disease. The 2 SNPs (rs151009667 and Val2095Glu) examined in the present study may promote FH disease development because of the appearance of homozygous and heterozygous variants.
