 DDX56 is a member of the DDX family of proteins that make up the largest RNA helicase family and are characterized by the presence of an Asp‐Glu‐Ala‐Asp (DEAD) motif. Several DDX family members play roles in alternative splicing.18, 19 DDX5 and DDX17 contribute to tumor‐cell invasiveness by regulating alternative splicing of several DNA‐ and chromatin‐binding factors.3 Although DDX56 is reported to be required in West Nile virus infection,39 the relationship of DDX56 with malignancies remains unknown. Our clinical analysis showed that DDX56 on Ch.7p is amplified in CRC, and overexpression is associated with malignant, pathological phenotypes, such as lymphatic invasion and distant metastasis. Notably, DDX56 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. In our experimental analysis, we found that DDX56 promotes cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression, possibly by inducing splicing alteration in tumor suppressor WEE1. Furthermore, DDX56 is overexpressed in various cancers. These findings provide clinical and biological evidence that DDX56 is a novel oncogene in CRC, and may function as a driver gene in various cancers in addition to CRC.
