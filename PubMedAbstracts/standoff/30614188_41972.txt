 Recent studies have identified EPAS1 (Mathew et al., 2014), CREBBP (Kumarswamy et al., 2014), MECP2 (Volkmann et al., 2013) and TNFSF13B (Alsaleh et al., 2014) as target genes of miR‐30a‐3p. Our study showed LINC01436 acts as a ceRNA to regulate EPAS1 by sponging miR‐30a‐3p in lung cancer. EPAS1, also named HIF‐2α, was associated with therapy resistance, metastasis and poor clinical prognosis in various cancers, including lung cancer (Ma et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015). High EPAS1 protein levels were detected in ~ 50% of cases and were strongly correlated with poor OS in NSCLC (Giatromanolaki et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2011), suggesting that EPAS1 may directly contribute to NSCLC progression. Ectopic overexpression of non‐degradable EPAS1 proteins cooperated with RAS to promote growth of Krasᴳ¹²ᴰ‐driven murine lung tumors (Kim et al., 2009). These studies suggested that increased EPAS1 activity plays important roles in lung cancer. However, the expression and clinical significance of EPAS1 in NSCLC tissues has not been definitively established. A recent multi‐omics analysis revealed that lung tumor tissues had low EPAS1 mRNA and protein expression compared with normal tissues (Wang et al., 2018). In our present study, EPAS1 mRNA expression levels were not correlated with LINC01436 expression levels in lung tumor tissues and no difference was found for EPAS1 protein expression between lung tumor tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues (Fig. S8). Thus, additional well‐designed clinical studies are warranted to better understand the expression and clinical significance of EPAS1 in NSCLC tissues.
