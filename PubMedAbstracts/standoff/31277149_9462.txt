 3 Results 3.1 Identification of DEMs and DEGs A total of 186, 173, and 75 DEMs were identified from the GSE55857, GSE43732, and GSE6188 datasets, respectively. As shown in Figure 2A, 26 DEMs were screened out in all 3 datasets, so that they could be identified as significant DEMs, which were hsa-miR-18b-5p, hsa-miR-503-5p, hsa-miR-9-3p, hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-34b-5p, hsa-miR-34c-5p, hsa-miR-339-3p, hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-133b, hsa-miR-203a, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-493-3p, hsa-miR-18a-3p, hsa-miR-130b-3p, hsa-miR-431-5p, hsa-miR-7-5p, hsa-miR-382-5p, hsa-miR-182-3p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-146b-5p, hsa-miR-196a-3p, hsa-miR-183-5p, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-196b-3p, and hsa-miR-497-5p. Figure 2 Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs). (A) Identification of DEMs; (B) Identification of upregulated DEGs; (C) Identification of downregulated DEGs. Compared with the normal samples, a total of 496 upregulated DEGs and 417 downregulated DEGs were identified in the ESCC samples (Fig. 2B and C). We obtained 18,501 target genes of the 26 significant DEMs from the miRWalk 2.0 database. The intersection number of these target genes and the upregulated DEGs that appeared in the three datasets was 96, while the intersection number of these candidate genes and the downregulated DEGs which appeared in three datasets was 184. Therefore, the 96 upregulated and 184 downregulated genes were identified as the final sets of significant DEGs.
