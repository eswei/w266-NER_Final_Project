 Although numerous studies have identified aberrant miRNA expression profiles in RA patients, only a few of these miRNAs have been well studied and have known targets 21 - 25 , 39 - 41 . For instance, miR-22 can target the 3'-UTR of cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), regulating inflammation response in the synovial cells from RA patients 39 . MiR-23b can bind to the 3'-UTRs of three genes, including TGF-β-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7- binding protein 2 (TAB2), TAB3 and IKK-α, resulting in the suppression of IL-17-, TNF-α- or IL-1β-mediated activation of NF-κB 40 . In this study, we found a total of 56 miRNAs with aberrant levels in foot and ankle RA patients, only a few of which have been reported to be involved in RA pathogenesis. For instance, miR-124a acts as a negative regulator of MCP-1 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA patients 42 . The DNA methylation-mediated downregulation of miR-34a in RA synovial fibroblasts can promote resistance to apoptosis by targeting X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) 43 . In addition, miR-146a is able to target tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) 44 . Although we only investigated the role of miR-7-5p here, we also found a few miRNAs that might target other TNF-α/NF-кB signaling members and NF-кB downstream targets by predicting their candidate targets in the miRNA database. For instance, miR-214-5p might bind to the 3'-UTR of TRAF2 (Supplementary Figure 3A), and a cluster of miRNAs, including miR-181a-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-181c-5p and miR-181d-5p, might target the 3'-UTR of TNF-α (Supplementary Figure 3B). We are currently verifying and investigating the roles of these miRNAs in the pathogenesis of RA but do not stress their importance in the present study. In addition, among these TNF-α/NF-кB signaling members, only IκBα was downregulated in RA patients 45 , 46 . We found an upregulated miRNA, miR-16-5p, was predicted to bind to the 3'-UTR of IκBα (Supplementary Figure 3C). These results indicated that not only the downregulated miRNAs but also the upregulated miRNAs might contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. Moreover, cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-17 have been shown to play roles in the regulation of miRNA expression 47 - 49 . For instance, both TNF-α and IL-1β can induce miR-146a expression 50 , while IL-17 can suppress miR-23b expression in RA 40 . We did not examine whether TNF-α or IL-1β can regulate the miR-7-5p level in this study, and we will conduct these experiments in the future.
