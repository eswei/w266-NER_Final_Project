 In addition to its role in CXCR4 regulation, FHC is well known as a subunit of the iron storage protein ferritin ( Knovich et al., 2009 ). As such, FHC protein expression is regulated by intracellular labile iron levels and iron-related stimuli including oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokines ( Torti and Torti, 2002 ; Wilkinson et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, clinical studies show that cognitive deficits in HAND are associated with increased levels of iron transport proteins in CSF ( Kallianpur et al., 2019 ), and that CSF iron and FHC levels are associated with CSF viral load and plasma virus detectability, respectively ( Patton et al., 2017 ). Therefore, increased CNS iron levels in HAND may drive the production of FHC, which could then lead to dendritic spine deficits and cognitive impairment. However, the mechanism by which morphine upregulates neuronal FHC is unclear. Since FHC is classically regulated by iron levels, and iron dysregulation is associated with HAND symptoms, we suspected that morphine may also upregulate FHC by modulating neuronal iron metabolism. Intriguingly, we found that morphine causes iron efflux from endolysosomes to the labile iron pool in the cytoplasm, which is required for FHC upregulation in cortical neurons. These results imply that opioid use and HIV infection may share a convergent mechanism leading to cognitive impairment, thus targeting brain-iron metabolism may be an effective approach for future HAND therapeutics.
