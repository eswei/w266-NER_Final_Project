 Mounting evidence has shown that lncRNAs act as ceRNAs that sponge miRNAs and reduce the binding of miRNAs to target genes, thereby regulating the expression of the target genes. Previous studies showed that SNHG1 functions as a ceRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma ²⁹ , ischaemic stroke ³⁰ and osteosarcoma ³¹ . Inspired by these studies, we hypothesized that SNHG1 regulates glioma progression via a ceRNA mechanism. Through a literature search, we found that SNHG1 could bound to miR-154-5p/miR-376b-3p and attenuate its expression, thereby regulating glioma progression ²⁸ . Based on these findings, we wondered whether SNHG1 can adsorb other miRNAs to regulate the progression of glioma. By searching online databases, nine miRNAs were identified as potential targets of SNHG1. Through a series of experiments, including luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays, we determined that miR-194 is the functional target of SNHG1. MiR-194 has been proven to be a tumour suppressor in various human cancers. For example, Sun et al. reported that miR-194 is involved in the progression of pancreatic cancer ³² . Li et al. showed that miR-194 has an effect on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of colorectal adenocarcinoma ³³ . In the present study, we concluded that miR-194 inhibits glucose uptake and the proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of glioma. We also demonstrated that PHLDA1 is the functional target of miR-194. Several studies have shown that PHLDA1 is involved in the development of gastric cancer ³⁴ , ovarian cancer ³⁵ and papillary adenocarcinoma ³⁶ . However, its role in glioma has not been reported in detail. In the current study, we showed that PHLDA1 is upregulated in glioma and promotes the malignant progress of glioma. We also performed a series of assays and found that the effect of sh-SNHG1 in glioma cells can be partly reversed by miR-194 inhibitors.
