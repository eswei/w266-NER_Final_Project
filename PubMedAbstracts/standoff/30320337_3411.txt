 MicroRNA-4295 (miR-4295) functions as an oncogene and may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer ( 10 ). According to a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) proliferation assay, proliferation was promoted by miR-4295, and miR-4295 was able to promote the invasion of the ATC cell line ( 11 ). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is an important transduction pathway that serves a vital role in tumor progression. The activated receptor pathway includes Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/Akt, STAT and Src family kinases, which promote the activation of transcription factors, leading to cell proliferation, invasion and migration ( 12 ). Leucinerich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) is a pan-negative regulator that is regarded as an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( 13 ). The results of a study undertaken by Jiang et al ( 12 ) indicated that dual blockage of EGFR and its downstream PI3K/Akt signaling can act as a valuable therapeutic method to promote the anti-proliferative activity of erlotinib in pancreatic cancer ( 12 ). LRIG1 is a pan-negative regulator of the EGFR signaling pathway ( 13 ). The overexpression of miR-4295 significantly promotes the proliferation, colony formation and migration of bladder cancer cells ( 10 ). EGFR is a vital signaling component that is associated with cell growth and survival. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation can increase cell proliferation in tumors ( 14 ). In the present study, the targeting association between miR-4295 and LRIG1 was determined by an initial bioinformatics prediction followed by a confirmatory dual-luciferase reporter assay. The present study aimed to confirm the hypothesis that miR-4295 inhibits the apoptosis of GC cells induced by DDP via the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by targeting the LRIG1 gene.
