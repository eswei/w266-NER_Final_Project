 N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) represents a predominant RNA modification that, not surprisingly, regulates tumorigenesis, and tumor progression ( 10 ). The m⁶A RNA modification is a reversible process that is coordinated by methyltransferase (m⁶A “writers”), m⁶A reader proteins and demethylase (m⁶A “erasers”) ( 11 ). These members cover more than 13 enzymes. The m⁶A “writers” complex consists of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, CBLL1, RBM15, ZC3H13, and VIRMA and is responsible for methylation of target RNA transcripts ( 12 ). Then, m⁶A readers, including YTHDF1-3, YTHDC1, IGF2BPs, and eIF3, discern these m⁶A modifications to direct RNA alternative splicing, translation, localization, and RNA stability, among other processes ( 13 ). However, as the m⁶A “erasers,” FTO and ALKBH5 remove m⁶A from the aforementioned target transcripts ( 14 , 15 ). FTO, the first identified m⁶A demethylase, belongs to the AlkB family of Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases ( 16 ). FTO mediates multiple RNA modifications, including m⁶A and m⁶Aₘ in mRNA and snRNA as well as m¹A in tRNA ( 17 ). Recent studies demonstrated that FTO plays an oncogenic role in cancers ( 18 – 20 ). For example, in one study, FTO significantly promoted leukemic cell proliferation, transformation, leukemogenesis, curtailed AML cell differentiation and apoptosis by targeting ASB2, and RARA ( 18 ). However, this process may be suppressed by R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) and IDH mutations, which competitively inhibit FTO ( 21 , 22 ). FTO also removes m⁶A from β-catenin to induce the chemo-radiotherapy resistance in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) ( 20 ). In addition, the overexpression of FTO can promote breast cancer and gastric cancer progression ( 19 , 23 ). These studies suggest that FTO participates in the regulation of various biological processes in cancer cells through modulation of the RNA transcripts which are critical to the respective pathways.
