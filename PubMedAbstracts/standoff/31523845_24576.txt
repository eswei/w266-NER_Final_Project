 The condensin I complex plays an important role in chromosome condensation and segregation.12, 13 The aberrant expression of the subunits of the complex causes incomplete chromosome condensation.14 NCAPH is a part of the condensin complex. A recent study showed that NCAPH is upregulated in colon cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have reveals that NCAPH transcript is present in proliferating cells and preceded by phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser‐10.15, 16 Various studies suggested that phosphorylation of histone H3 serine contributed to the HCC progression.17 Thus, we hypothesis that NCAPH could promotes HCC progression. First, we detected the expression of NCAPH in HCC tissue and ANLTs, and found NCAPH was increased in HCC tissues compared with ANLTs. Then we analyzed the relationship between NCAPH expression and prognosis. The results demonstrated that the aberrant expression of NCAPH is associated with poor survival in patients with HCC. However, the role of NCAPH in HCC cells remains unexplored. In this study, we found that the proliferation ability of HCC cells was significantly reduced in NCAPH knockdown cells compared with that in the control group cells by CCK‐8 and CFA assay. To further verify our results, we established NCAPH‐overexpressing cell lines. The results showed that cells with higher levels of NCAPH showed increased proliferation rates in the CCK‐8 and CFA assay. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of NCAPH suppressed HCC proliferation in vivo and that the expression of the proliferation marker gene Ki‐67 was significantly decreased in NCAPH knockdown tumors.
