 Yamauchi et al. reported that Gal-9 has an anti-metastatic effect on breast cancer cells. They also showed that survival ratio for Gal-9-positive patients were better compared with Gal-9-negative group( 10 ). It has been also shown Gal-9 inhibited the cell proliferation of five myeloma cell lines, and also this effect was mediated by activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3( 11 ). Fujita et al. showed that Gal-9 inhibited cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma with induction of apoptosis but did not affect cell cycle arrest, in vitro and in vivo. They also proposed that Gal-9 might be a candidate agent for hepatocellular carcinoma chemotherapy( 12 ). Another study showed that Gal-9 induces apoptosis through caspase-1 pathway( 13 ). In addition, Jiang et al. indicated that Gal-9 in the tumor cells may be a critical target to treatment of gastric cancer( 14 ). Previous studies have also shown the anti-cancer activity of Gal-9 via induction of apoptosis in hematological and gastrointestinal cancer( 4 ). A previous study showed the expression of Gal-9 in OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer( 15 ). Taken together, these data propose that Gal-9 could be considered as an appropriate candidate for treatment of some cancers. To the best of our knowledge, data on the role of Gal-9 in ovarian cancer is very scarce. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the anti-cancer effects of Gal-9 on OVCAR-3, a human ovarian cancer cell line, to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of its effect.
