 Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a biomarker synthesized endogenously in the human respiratory tract, plays a key role in physiological regulation of airway function, including neurotransmission, vasodilation, and immunoregulation. 6 Moreover, FENO is implicated in the pathophysiology of airway disease, and elevated FENO level is found in inflammatory lung disorders such as asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and cystic fibrosis. 7 The measurement of FENO has been suggested as a simple and noninvasive test in eosinophilic airway inflammation, and the utility in aiding diagnosis and monitoring of asthma has also been confirmed. 7 , 8 However, limited by the inconsistent results of FENO level in COPD, the value and application in this case still remains unknown. Interestingly, it was reported that FENO levels in patients with COPD could be reduced by smoking and inhaled corticosteroids, which indicated they were confounding factors in measuring FENO levels in COPD. COPD involves excessive inflammation in airway and lung, which induces the release of numerous proinflammatory cytokines. Yet, the available studies regarding FENO levels are controversial and conflicting in their conclusions. To address this issue, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to determine the levels of FENO in COPD, aiming to further the understanding of the role of FENO in patients with COPD.
