 We reported that MELAS is associated with endothelial dysfunction using endothelial-dependent vasodilatation methods by a high-resolution doppler echocardiography [ 4 ]. Because patients with MELAS have defective respiratory chain enzyme activities, a high NADH/NAD⁺ ratio inhibits the nitric oxide (NO) synthetase reaction to cause a decreased production of NO at the endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells in the artery. In addition, asymmetrical dimethyl-arginine (ADMA), a risk factor of ischemic heart disorders, was relatively increased in patients with MELAS [ 5 ], which may lead to a negative effect on the endothelial NO synthetase activity. Indeed, decreased NO metabolite concentrations during SLE and lower NO synthesis rate were observed in patients with MELAS [ 5 – 8 ]. If hyperactive cytochrome c oxidase (COX) may decrease the regional NO concentration, all of the above scenarios lead to the segmental vasodilatation defect especially in the segment of strongly SDH-reactive blood vessel (SSV) regions in the cerebral artery or arterioles. These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction because of NO deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of SLE [ 9▪ , 10 , 11 ]. Low plasma concentration of l-arginine, a potent donor of NO, observed in patients with MELAS [ 5 , 8 ] supports the hypothesis and indicates the therapeutic potential of l-arginine on SLE.
