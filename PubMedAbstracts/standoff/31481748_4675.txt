 Targeting microRNAs (miRNAs), or their associated regulatory networks, which are dysregulated in TNBC might represent a viable strategy for targeted therapeutics. miRNAs are short (18–23 nt) non-coding RNAs that regulate virtually all biological functions via post-transcriptional gene silencing. Altered miRNA expression is common during cancer initiation and metastasis ⁶ . A systems level analysis of miRNA expression in human breast tumours revealed that specific miRNAs may serve as potential oncogenes or tumour suppressors and function by modulating the immune response that characterizes these tumours ⁹ . In fact, miRNA expression signatures are also correlated with the hormone receptor status in breast cancer. Three classes of miRNA signatures corresponding with ER (miR-342, miR-299, miR-217, miR-190, miR-135b and miR-218), PR (miR-520g, miR-377, miR-527–518a and miR-520f-520c) and HER2 (miR-520d, miR-181c, miR-302c, miR-376b and miR-30e) have been characterized, respectively ¹⁰ . Moreover, as many as 133 miRNAs are differentially expressed between tumours and healthy tissue ⁷ . An array of studies has been published on miRNA signatures in TNBC that have elucidated the roles of miRNAs in the progression or suppression of tumors. A number of them are overexpressed, namely miR-221, miR-222, miR-100, miR-146a, miR-125b ¹¹ – ¹⁴ , miR-29a, miR-31, miR-130a, miR-140-3p, miR-455, miR-199a/b-3p ¹⁴ , miR-135-5p, miR-18-5p, miR-9-5p, miR-522-3p ¹⁵ , while miRNA genes like miR-26a ¹⁶ , miR-20a-5p ¹⁷ , miR-124 ¹⁸ , miR-200, miR-182, miR-141, miR-375, miR-203 ¹¹ – ¹³ , miR-190-5p, miR-449a ¹⁵ , have reduced expression in TNBC tumours. Among this list of differentially expressed miRNAs, we have previously demonstrated oncogenic potential for miR-138 in recurrent malignant gliomas, and were interested in exploring its roles in the context of breast cancer. In gliomas, miR-138 is transcribed by RNA Pol III ⁸ and promotes the survival of glioma stem cells ⁹ . Aberrant miR-138 expression has been reported in various cancers including anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), NSCLC, and gallbladder carcinoma ¹⁰ – ¹² . Increased expression of miR-138 in TNBC has been reported ¹¹ , ¹³ , ¹⁹ , ²⁰ . miR-138 may modulate metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) ²¹ . By and large, epigenetic and genetic changes in cancer cells during malignant transformation alter the suite of mRNAs available as targets for miRNAs. Therefore, the cellular context-specific function of miRNAs depends on the available cohorts of downstream effectors ¹³ . Hence, we hypothesize that in breast cancer, tumour cells might differ in their behaviour, including their expression and utilization of miR-138, by subtype.
