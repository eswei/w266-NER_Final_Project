 Among these hyperphosphorylation sites induced by AD P-tau in vivo, phosphorylation of tau at Ser422 was very interesting. Increase of Ser422 phosphorylation was found in the contralateral hippocampus and the ipsilateral cortex, where very limited tau pathology were observed. Thus, Ser422 phosphorylation may be an early event in AD P-tau-induced tau pathology. Several kinases are able to phosphorylate Ser422, including Jnk/SAPK (Wang and Liu, 2008 ). PP2A and PP5 effectively dephosphorylate Ser422 (Liu et al., 2002 ). Treatment of brain slices with OA induces tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple sites, with the most increase at Ser422 (Gong et al., 2000 ; Qian et al., 2010 ). Ser422 is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in AD brain (Liu et al., 2009 ). Normal tau protein has been proposed to have a “paper clip” structure, in which the N- and C-terminal ends fold over the microtubule-binding domain to prevent the protein from self-aggregation (Mandelkow et al., 2007 ). Ser422 phosphorylation may make tau C-terminus to stretch out and expose the microtubule-binding domain, thereby leading to tau captured easily by AD P-tau. Specially, Ser422 was the only site to be hyperphosphorylated in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi and the ipsilateral cortex of AD P-tau injected Tg/hTau mice. Thus, Ser422 phosphorylation may be critical in AD P-tau-induced aggregation/tau pathology, but this remains to be determined in future studies.
