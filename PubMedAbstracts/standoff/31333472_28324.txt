 P-gp can restrict the entry of various substrates, such as antidepressants, from the bloodstream into the brain. Studies on ABCB1 knockout animals have shown that ABCB1−/− mice possess higher intracerebral concentrations of escitalopram, trimipramine, amitriptyline, doxepin, venlafaxine, and paroxetine compared with those in wild-type mice ( Uhr et al., 2000 ; Uhr et al., 2002 ; Uhr et al., 2003 ). Kato et al. (2008) reported a significant association of the nonsynonymous SNP G2677T/A (rs2032582) with treatment response to paroxetine in depressed patients. Moreover, the wild variant haplotype 3435C–2677G–1236T is associated with poor response ( Kato et al., 2008 ). In contrast, Nikisch et al. (2008) found that depressed patients harboring the 2677 GG/GT genotype responded to escitalopram treatment significantly better than patients with the 2677TT genotype and suggested that this polymorphism could be used as genetic markers for predicting treatment response to escitalopram treatment in MDD (n = 15). Uhr et al. (2008) showed that polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene predict the response to antidepressant treatment in depressed patients (n = 133) receiving drugs that have been identified as substrates of P-gp (amitriptyline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and escitalopram). However, Mihaljevic et al. (2008) found that MDR1 variants G2677T (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642) are not associated with therapeutic response to paroxetine in patients with MDD (n = 127). Furthermore, Peters et al. (2008) did not find an association between ABCB1C3435T, G2677T, and C1236T polymorphisms and response and tolerance to citalopram in a large study sample (n = 831).
