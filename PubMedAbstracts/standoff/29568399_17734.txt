 Previously, we generated a MeS-like experimental model and found that CTBP1 and MeS increased breast tumor growth by regulating multiple genes and miRNAs involved in cell proliferation, progenitor cells phenotype, EMT, mammary development and cell communication [ 10 ]. To elucidate CTBP1 and MeS effect on BrCa progression in vivo, here we analyzed expression levels of genes involved in key steps of tumor progression in xenografts generated in the MeS-like model. Moreover, we showed that CTBP1 induced ITGB4 and PRSS2, while MeS regulated COL17A1 and FABP4 genes. In addition, MeS induced ITGB6 only in CTBP1-high expression xenografts, suggesting that CTBP1 activation by MeS could be critical for ITGB6 expression. These results support our previous studies showing that, in vivo, CTBP1 and MeS regulate the mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Slug [ 10 ]. Importantly, integrins dysregulation is associated with cancer development and progression, since these are heterodimeric cell surface receptors critical for adhesion, migration, invasion, growth, survival and differentiation [ 21 ]. Interestingly, ITGB4 constitutes a marker of basal-like tumors [ 22 ] and it is a downstream effector of cell migration mediated by the mesenchymal marker Vimentin [ 23 ], which promotes BrCa invasion through the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics [ 24 ]. Thus, CTBP1 emerges as a master regulator of EMT in BrCa inducing Vimentin and its downstream target ITGB4. Also, ITGB6 is a known inductor of cell invasion and is a marker of poor prognosis in several cancer types, including BrCa [ 25 â€“ 28 ]. Altogether, these results suggest that CTBP1 hyperactivation by MeS is a critical event that might be considered for prognosis assessment in BrCa patients.
