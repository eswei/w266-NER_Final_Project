 Aberrant expression of miR-192 played a crucial role in the development and progression of multiple malignant tumors ( 34 â€“ 36 ). Previous studies have proved that miR-192 was significantly downregulated in many cancers, and miR-192 also has been reported to regulate cell biological functions in tumors, including proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis ( 37 , 38 ). For instance, Feng et al ( 15 ) suggested that miR-192-5p was significantly low in lung cancer. They further demonstrated that miR-192-5p suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis through RB1. Lian et al ( 16 ) also proved that miR-192-5p reduced tumor metastasis by targeting the SLC39A6/SNAIL pathway in HCC cells. Although previous study had researched the effect of miR-192 on human osteosarcoma, which indicated that miR-192 was downregulated in osteosarcoma and miR-192 could suppressed the progression of osteosarcoma ( 17 , 39 ), the exact molecular mechanism remained largely unclear. Consistent with the above studies, we identified that upregulation of miR-192-5p inhibited cell proliferation by preventing cell cycle from G1 to S phase and inducing cell apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. We also found that miR-192-5p repressed cell migration and invasion, and increased cells more sensitivity to cisplatin in osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, we came to the conclusion that miR-192-5p played an important role in suppressing osteosarcoma.
