 Mutational signature analysis also revealed unique features. N3 tumors preferentially had mutation signature 17 with frequent T > C and T > G mutations at the CpTpT site, but the N0 tumors did not. Recurrent T > G mutations at TpT dinucleotides converting CpTpT to CpGpT have been found in esophageal adenocarcinomas ⁴² and GCs ¹¹ . We also identified significantly deleterious mutations (SDMs) including some in previously known cancer genes (e.g., TP53, ARID1A, NCOR2, and RHOA). Frequent mutations of TP53 have been shown in DGCs. ARID1A, encoding a member of the SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling family, has been suggested to act as a tumor-suppressor gene by regulating the cell cycle or promoting apoptosis in various cancers ⁴³ . Recently, inactivating mutations or protein deficiency of ARID1A have frequently been observed in gastric cancers ²⁹ , ⁴⁴ . In addition, a mutation of DYNC2H1 was newly identified as an N3-specific SDM. Mutations of DYNC2H1 have been associated with the progression of fibromuscular dysplasia ⁴⁵ and short-rib polydactyly syndrome; ⁴⁶ however, its cancer-related functions have not been elaborated thoroughly. In addition, an integrated analysis of our data and the TCGA data identified additional N3-specific recurrent mutations (i.e., TP53 and FAT4). FAT4, a cadherin-related protein, has been proposed to have a tumor-suppressor role, and its mutation has been noticed in GC. Silencing of FAT4 promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in GC cells ²⁸ , ⁴⁷ , ⁴⁸ . Moreover, the downregulation of FAT4 expression has been associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival in GC patients ²⁸ . We suggest that these differential mutations between N0 and N3 tumors may play crucial roles in DGC progression; thus, they warrant further elucidation.
