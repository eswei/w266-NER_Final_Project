 The present study showed that obesity occurred after treatment of folate deficient diet in mice. CFD also led to lipid metabolism disorders. It was recognized that folate and phosphatidylcholine metabolism are inter-related. An animal study showed that folate deficiency decreased flux through phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme that synthesizes phosphatidylcholine via the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine [ 31 ]. Phosphatidylcholine is a major component of VLDL, which transport triglycerides out of liver [ 32 ]. Therefore, decreased phosphatidylcholine levels would lead to the reduction of VLDL in the liver tissues and the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides [ 33 ]. The present study showed increased serum triglycerides and VLDL levels. In cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice, an animal model for hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated serum homocysteine levels inhibited intravascular VLDL lipolysis, resulting in elevated serum VLDL levels [ 34 ]. Previous studies demonstrated that lower phosphatidylcholine promoted Srebp1 proteolytic maturation and its target gene expression, including Acc1 and Fasn, two rate-limiting enzymes for fatty acid synthesis [ 35 â€“ 37 ]. In agreement with these results, Yu X et al. showed that folate supplement decreased the expression of Fasn mRNA [ 38 ]. However, CFD decreased the fatty acid transporter Cd36 mRNA [ 39 ]. These results suggested that CFD increased hepatic fatty acid synthesis whereas limited lipid transporting out of the liver. Moreover, histopathology showed that hepatic lipid accumulation, a known determinant of insulin resistance, was observed in the CFD group. These results suggested that CFD induced lipid metabolism disorders, which may be related to insulin resistance.
