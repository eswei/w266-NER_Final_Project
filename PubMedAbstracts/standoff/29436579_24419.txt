 In the present study, it was demonstrated that podocytes were damaged in the kidneys of rats with STZ-induced diabetes, while the downregulation of PODXL1 and nephrin expression levels, as well as the upregulation of Î±-SMA and vimentin expression levels were observed. Nephrin is the first protein to be identified at the glomerular podocyte slit diaphragm and its expression has been described to be transiently increased in the first 8 weeks subsequent to the establishment of a diabetes animal model. The downregulation of nephrin expression was identified in the kidneys of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients ( 34 ). In addition, nephrin is a podocyte-specific protein; thus, a reduction in its expression may reflect podocyte loss in diabetic rats, and this loss can lead to a range of renal diseases, including DN ( 35 ). Podocalyxin (PODX) is expressed by kidney podocytes, vascular endothelia and a subset of neurons ( 36 ). Aberrant expression of PODX contributes to podocyte-associated renal diseases ( 37 ). PODXL1 is an anti-adhesive transmembrane protein that has been reported to be expressed on the foot processes of podocytes in the kidney glomerulus, as well as on the endothelium at certain sites ( 36 ). The results of the present study revealed that PODXL1 expression was decreased in diabetic rats following STZ injection, which is consistent with the observations of a previous study ( 38 ).
