 MiR-30c has been identified to be tumor suppressive and downregulated in various cancers. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, downregulated miR-30c inhibited biological behaviors and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of ESCC by directly targeting SNAI1[ 18 ]. In breast cancer, micRNA-30c negatively regulated collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 and suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis[ 5 ]. MiRNA-30c inhibited proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells by targeting Rab18[ 19 ]. In our study, we found that downregulation of miR-30c occurred widely in pancreatic cancer, and predicted a poor prognosis. Similarly, miR-30c was downregulated in five pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with HPDE. Consistent with these findings, experiments in vitro and in vivo showed that re-expression of miR-30c significantly inhibited cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and G1-phase arrest. Bioinformatics prediction analysis was carried out to search for potential targets of miR-30c and identified TWF1 as a promising target. TWF1 was shown to be a target of miR-30c. Furthermore, rescue experiments showed that enforced overexpression of TWF1 could strongly restore the proliferation of miR-30c-overexpressing cells. The TWF1 mRNA level exhibited an inverse correlation with the level of miRNA-30c in both pancreatic cancer patient tissues and subcutaneous tumors derived from nude mice. We concluded that miR-30c might exert its effect by influencing TWF1 expression to inhibit pancreatic cancer proliferation.
