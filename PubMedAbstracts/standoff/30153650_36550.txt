 4 Discussion Cardiovascular diseases are closely linked to hypertension. The risk of DCM, characterized by ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic and diastolic function, is doubled when the blood pressure exceeds 160/95 mmHg [36] . A recent estimate indicated that the risk for cardiovascular disease for each 10 mm Hg increment in systolic blood pressure from baseline is 25% for women and 15% for men in the USA [37] . Genome-wide linkage studies have revealed that the loci of the human D5R (hD5R), 4p15.1–16.1, and its pseudo genes, 1q21.1 2p11.1-p11.2, are linked to essential hypertension [9] , [38] , [39] . Moreover, hD5F¹⁷³ᴸ has diminished cAMP activity and D5R function, which transgenosis in mice signifiantly inhibit endogenous D5R expression (Supplementary Fig. 1). We have found that global hD5F¹⁷³ᴸ-TG mice have high blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy [10] . In our current study, the blood pressures of cardiac-specific hD5F¹⁷³ᴸ-TG mice were normal and not significantly different from those observed in cardiac-specific hD5ᵂᵀ-TG mice at 3 months of age (Supplementary Fig. 4A) and 4 months of age (not shown). Therefore, the DCM in cardiac-specific hD5F¹⁷³ᴸ-TG mice is a direct cardiac effect of the mutant human D5R gene rather than a compensatory dilatation due to pressure overload. We now highlight the observation that D5R is necessary for the normal expression of Nrf2 and inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity and that their dysfunctions stimulate ROS over-production and myocardial remodeling via ERK1/2/JNK pathway (Fig. 11). Fig. 11 D5R mutation induces dilated cardiomyopathy that is related to oxidative stress. D5R deficiency causes an increase in NADPH oxidase activity (I), and prevents the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus (II), resulting in a failure of the transcription of a number of antioxidative genes via masculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) and antioxidant response elements (ARE). Antioxidant proteins include NAD(P)H quinone 1 dehydrogenase (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1). Oxidative stress accelerates the signaling of the ERK1/2 and JNK pathway, impairing the balance between apoptosis (BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator [BAX]) and anti-apoptosis (B aggressive lymphoma protein 2 (BAL2, PARP14 gene). Phospholamban (PLN) is also stimulated which inhibits cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA, encoded by ATP2A2), which in turn causes cardiac remodeling and finally, dilated cardiomyopathy. D5R deficiency also allows Kelch-like ECH Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) to target Nrf2 in the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Fig. 11
