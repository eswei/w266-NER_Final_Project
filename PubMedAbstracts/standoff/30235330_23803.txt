 It was reported that phenylalanine at position 9 in DPβ chain was reported to be independently associated with European ACPA(+)RA [ 21 ]. Glycine at position 84 in DPβ chain was also independently associated with Japanese ACPA(+)RA [ 23 ]. However, the independently associated DPB1 alleles were not reported in these studies. In the present study, glycine at position 84 in DPβ chain was independently associated with ACPA(+)RA and 84G-85G-86P-87M-96R in DPβ chain was the ACPA(+)RA susceptible haplotype. This ACPA(+)RA associated haplotype was included in DPB1*02:01, DPB1*02:02, DPB1*04:01, DPB1*04:02, and DPB1*41:01. Since the alleles other than DPB1*02:01 were not directly associated with ACPA(+)RA susceptibility (Table 2, right column), DPB1*02:01 would be mainly contributed to the risk of ACPA(+)RA among them. The independent association of phenylalanine at position 9 in DPβ chain was not confirmed in the present study, though this amino acid residue was included in DPB1*02:01 and other alleles. This could be explained by the different distribution of HLA alleles in other ethnic populations. The amino acid residues 84, 85, 86, and 87 form the pocket 1 of DP peptide-binding groove [ 34 ]. This information suggested the involvement of peptides loaded on DP2 in the generation of ACPA or rheumatoid factor.
