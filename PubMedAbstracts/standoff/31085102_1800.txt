 Research in context Evidence before this study The overactivation of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) pathway plays an important role in many cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, LTA4H is considered to be a target for cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Added value of this study In this study, we showed that the classical LTA4H inhibitor, bestatin, significantly inhibited LTB4 production. LTB4 is catalytic product of LTA4H and might serve as a blood biomarker for bestatin efficacy in CRC patients. Bestatin also significantly down-regulated the LTA4H signaling pathway and reduced proliferation and expression of Ki-67. Furthermore, bestatin effectively decreased the concentration of LTB4 and inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in the Apcᴹⁱⁿ/⁺ mouse model and in a CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) SCID mouse model. These animal studies confirmed data obtained from clinical patient samples and support further studies for LTA4H inhibition in CRC. Implications of all the available evidence Our studies suggest that LTB4 can serve as a blood biomarker for bestatin efficacy in CRC patients. In addition, our findings suggest that LTA4H is a promising molecular target in CRC. Alt-text: Unlabelled Box
