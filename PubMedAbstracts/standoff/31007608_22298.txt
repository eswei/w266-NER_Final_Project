 In the ceRNA network, the lncRNA LINC00221 (connection degree = 2) had the highest connection degree among the prognostic DElncRNAs (MYCNOS, DLX6-AS1, LINC00221, and CRNDE) (Additional file 5: Table S5). Therefore, we concluded that it might exert a strong influence on HCC pathogenesis. Russell et al. showed that the expression of LINC00221 is 2.4-fold higher in high-risk neuroblastomas than in low-risk neuroblastomas [ 30 ]. LINC00221 was involved in ceRNA networks in several tumor types. Fan et al. reported that LINC00221 is upregulated in breast cancer compared to adjacent-normal breast tissues and is involved in the lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA ceRNA network of breast cancer [ 31 ]. He et al. demonstrated that LINC00221 is dysregulated in gastric cancer and competes with six miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑96, hsa‑miR‑143, hsa‑miR‑204, hsa‑miR‑372, hsa‑miR‑373 and hsa‑miR‑519d) to mediate target mRNA expression in gastric cancer [ 32 ]. Zhang et al. found that LINC00221 is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer, and an 11‑lncRNA signature consisting of LINC00221 can predict the survival rate for gastric cancer [ 33 ]. Wang et al. noted that LINC00221 is involved in the lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA ceRNA network of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and its high expression level was significantly related to the progression of muscle-invasive bladder cancer [ 34 ]. Our study also showed that LINC00221 expression is 77-fold higher in HCC tissues than in paired nontumorous tissues. Increased expression of LINC00221 was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Moreover, we found that LINC00221 might compete with two key DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-182 and hsa-miR-96) to mediate target DEmRNA expression in HCC.
