 Of note, because of lots of common risk factors, a great number of patients with CAD have varying degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The heart failure caused by CAD can also lead to renal insufficiency. In addition, it is reported that CKD patients have higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), which indicate the highly interrelated feature of them.[ ⁹ , ¹⁰ ] Ang-2, besides its role in angiogenesis, also controls the vascular inflammation[ ¹¹ ] and plays an important role in CKD. Pathophysiological characteristics of CKD, such as hypoxia, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), can lead to endothelial Ang-2 secretion;[ ¹¹ – ¹³ ] Serum Ang-2 levels increase with progression of CKD and are closely related to renal function.[ ¹⁴ ] Besides, serum angiopoietin-2 is associated with albuminuria and markers of systemic microinflammation in CKD patients.[ ¹⁵ ] Even in the general population, after exclusion of subjects with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, serum Ang-2 concentrations are also highly associated with the parameters of renal function.[ ¹⁶ ] In vivo, glomerular Ang-2 is increased in glomerulonephritis.[ ¹⁷ ] In renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, Ang-2 is highly expressed and involved in renal microvascular remodeling and development of fibrosis.[ ¹⁸ ]
