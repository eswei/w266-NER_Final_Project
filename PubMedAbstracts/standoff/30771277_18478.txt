 Kim [ 18 ] examined whether the rate of PD-1/PD-L1 positivity differed in patients with different types of malignant tumors. The PD-1/PD-L1 positive rate in liver cancer was significantly higher than that in breast cancer. Sunshine found that the number of PD-1‚Å∫ T cells in gastric cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, melanoma, and other malignant tumors was significantly higher than that in healthy patients, and was positively correlated with tumor progression [ 8 ]. Swaika found that the expression level of sPD-1 protein was significantly increased in melanoma, as shown by ELISA [ 19 ]. Chen found that plantar injection of sPD-1 to mice quickly induced spontaneous pain and mechanical tactile allodynia and led to conditioned place preference, but the immunity indexes were not affected by sPD-1 [ 20 ]. PD-1 expression is sufficient to mask the cancer pain resulting from melanoma. After intravenous injection of nivolumab and RMP1-14, mice with melanoma developed spontaneous pain and mechanical tactile allodynia [ 21 ]. Blocking downstream signals of PD-1 also caused spontaneous pain in mice with melanoma [ 22 ]. These findings suggest that PD-L1 masks the cancer pain resulting from non-metastatic melanoma via PD-1 [ 23 ]. In the present study, the rate of PD-1 positivity on T cells in patients with liver cancer and melanoma was significantly higher than that in breast cancer patients. In patients with liver cancer and melanoma, there was no obvious pain sensation in the early stage, which may be related to the high expression of PD-L1 in liver cancer and melanoma that markedly inhibited and alleviated pain via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.
