 Previous studies have revealed that SUZ12 is an oncogene that promotes tumorigenesis and a potential biomarker as well as anticancer therapeutic target in various tumors 12 , 14 , 19 , 20 . Wu Y et al. 12 reported that SUZ12 was overexpressed in HNSCC, which elevated SUZ12 expression significantly associated with cervical node metastasis and the reduced overall survival. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), SUZ12 was up-regulated in EOC tissues, and SUZ12 overexpression predicted shorter overall survival 17 . However, our study showed that the expression level of SUZ12 protein was decreased in HBV-related HCC tissues compared with the corresponding para-tumor and non-tumor tissues (Fig.1B and Fig.6). This is consistent with previous findings that SUZ12 is down-regulated in HBV-replicating cells and liver tumor tissues of HBV-induced HCC animal models 9 , 10 , which down-regulation of SUZ12 occurs in liver tumor of woodchucks chronically infected by woodchuck hepatitis virus 31 . Moreover, the analysis performed in our study showed a significant correlation between SUZ12 overexpression and better clinical outcome (Fig.1C). These current researches strongly suggest the tumor suppressing role of SUZ12 in HCC.
