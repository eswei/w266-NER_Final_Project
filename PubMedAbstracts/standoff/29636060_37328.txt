 Conclusion The present study demonstrates that apoC1 rs4420638A/G and -317H1/H2 genetic polymorphisms are not associated with the risk of PCOS in Chinese women. However, the apoC1 rs4420638A → G variation may potentially be linked to elevated serum LH levels, a relatively high ratio of LH to FSH, and an adverse lipid metabolic profile; and the -317 H1H1 genotype is associated with increased the ratio of apoB-PAF-AH to H-PAF-AH activity and the acne grade score in the patients with PCOS. Additionally, this study also indicates that apoC1 rs4420638A/G and -317H1/H2 genetic variations are associated with an adverse glucose and lipid metabolic profile and the rs4420638G allele increases plasma PAF-AH and apoB-PAF-AH activity in the control women. These results suggest that apoC1 rs4420638A/G and -317H1/H2 genetic variants are related to metabolic abnormalities and chronic inflammation in patients and controls, while the rs4420638A/G polymorphism might be involved in endocrine abnormalities of reproductive axis in patients.
