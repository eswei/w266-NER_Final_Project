 As an acute immune response NF-κB directs the cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 to the inflammatory sites. However, hyper activation of NF-κB has been contributed for the cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, NF-κB was considered to play “double edged role” in the immune system. On one hand, stimulation of NF-κB directs the leukocytes to the inflammatory sites as part of innate immunity. On the other hand, tumors can principally establish the elevated NF-κB activity by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Especially mutation of NF-κB and constant release of cytokines majorly contribute for the cancer progression. In the myeloid cell of the tumor environment, upstream IκB kinase (IKK2)-mediated NF-κB activity contributes to the tumor progression by inducing the secretion of cytokines and growth factors [ 19 ]. Study of prostate and breast cancer revealed occurrence of mutation in NF-κB, IKK2 as well as inhibitors IκBα and IκBε [ 20 ]. Inflammation in colon cancer is associated with the hyper activation of IKK2-induced NF-κB within intestinal epithelial cells [ 21 ]. Cellular location of NF-κB activity is fundamental for the development of liver cancer [ 22 ]. In melanoma, IKK2 and NF-κB activation is required for the tumorigenesis [ 23 ]. NF-κB activity is mainly involved in the survival of the tumor cells to prevent from the apoptotic or senescent. Therefore, suppression of NF-κB activation is considered as a central mechanism in the prohibition of tumor growth [ 24 ]. Therefore, knowledge on the mechanism of NF-κB and its interaction with the beta-catenin/cyclin D1 pathway is essential for finding the novel therapeutic agent(s).
