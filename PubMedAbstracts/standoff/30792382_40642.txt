 SUV420H2 specifically trimethylates Lys-20 of histone H4 causing transcriptional repression of associated genes ¹⁰ , ¹² , ⁴² , and loss of histone H4K20 trimethylation predicted poor prognosis in breast cancer and was associated with invasive activity ¹⁴ , ¹⁵ , suggesting that SUV420H2 and H4K20 trimethylation were involved in the progression of metastatic breast cancer. However, few studies provide the underlying mechanism for the phenomenon or the regulation of SUV420H2 in breast cancer. In this study, we first demonstrated that miR-29a targeted SUV420H2 and caused the loss of H4K20me3 by directly binding the 3′-UTR of the SUV420H2 mRNA, which was required for breast cancer cells migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that miR-29a functioned as an oncogene in breast cancer by targeting SUV420H2 for the first time. Aberrant epigenetic alterations in the genome including DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNA expression, and chromatin remodeling, play significant roles in breast cancer development ⁴³ and BCSC genes turn on ⁴⁴ . Methyltransferase such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), demethylase such as Ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, histone-modifying enzymes such as histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) ⁴⁵ , and zeste homolog 2(EZH2) ⁴⁶ are important regulators associated with epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, miR-29a has been shown to target various types of epigenetics regulators in cancer cells. miR-29a down-regulates DNMT3A and −3B in lung cancer cells ⁴⁷ and hepatocytes ⁴⁸ while targets TET in malignant hematopoietic cells ⁴⁹ , hepatocellular carcinoma cells ⁵⁰ , breast cancer cells and embryonic stem cells ⁵¹ , ⁵² . These findings together with our data indicate that miR-29a-targeting epigenetics regulators was a critical approach to facilitate tumorigenesis.
