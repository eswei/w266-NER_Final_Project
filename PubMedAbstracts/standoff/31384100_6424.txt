 Little is known about the exact pathogenesis of HT. However, considering that certain families are more susceptible to this disease than others, it is likely that genetic factors are involved. Previous reports suggest the possible association of HT with polymorphisms of HLA, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), or thyroglobulin (Tg) genes ( 6 ). In particular, the HLA gene is associated with a number of autoimmune diseases. An HA20 patient demonstrating very early-onset psoriatic arthritis, spondylitis, and aortic insufficiency was reported. This patient also had another possible genetic factor, HLA-B27, which is well known to cause psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis ( 2 ). Thus, we considered that HA20 might drive other genetic factors associated with autoimmune disorders such as HLA. HT is linked to particular HLA antigens or HLA alleles such as A2 ( 7 ), A*02:07 ( 8 ), DR3 ( 9 ), DRB1*03:01 ( 10 ), DR4 (DR53, DRB4) ( 7 - 9 ), DR5 ( 11 ), and DRB1*11:04 ( 12 ). Furthermore, because both the TNFAIP3 and HLA are located on chromosome 6, we speculate that an association exists between TNFAIP3 and HLA. As a result, P2, P3, P4, and P5 all have the DRB1*14:03 allele, which has been demonstrated as the susceptible HLA allele for GD in the Japanese population, but not for HT ( 13 ). To our knowledge, the identified common HLA allele is not reported to be associated with HT. Hence, in the present family, it is considered that TNFAIP3 dominantly contributes to the pathogenesis of HT without any relation to HLA. Nonetheless, this study is limited because we cannot exclude other genetic effects such as CTLA4.
