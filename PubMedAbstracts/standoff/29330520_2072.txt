 Homocysteine (Hcy), a homologue of the amino acid cysteine, is a sulfurcontaining amino acid, which can be recycled to methionine or trans-sulfurated to cystathionine required for pyridoxial-5phosphate ⁴ . Raised concentration of Hcy has been suggested as an independent risk factor for stroke, especially in the Chinese hypertension patients ⁵ . The concentration of Hcy is known to be influenced by a common variant of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T ⁶ , in which T/T genotype leads to a reduction in enzyme activity, resulting in decreased folate level and increased Hcy. It has been reported that the effect of Hcy on stroke was siginificantly modified by the MTHFR C677T genotype ⁷ . However, there is little study focusing on the joint effect of Hcy and MTHFR C677T with ICAS or ECAS. Hypertension has been associated with both ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of stroke, as well as with ICAS and ECAS ⁸ , ⁹ . We hereby aim to investigate the association of Hcy concentration with ICAS and ECAS in hypertensive patients without stroke in Chinese population; furthermore, we sought to examine the effect of MTHFR C677T on their relationship.
