 It has been reported that hyperglycemia-induced myocardial tissue oxidative stress is associated with inflammation by overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 20 NF-κB is a pleiotropic transcription factor that controls the expression of multiple target genes and is primarily involved in inflammation. When NF-κB is blocked, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in myocardial tissue are simultaneously reduced, and cardiac dysfunction in type 2 diabetic mice is alleviated. 21 In the heart, activation of NF-κB signaling is associated with different pathophysiological environments, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy and diabetic cardiomyopathy. 22 Our study found that the expression of NF-κB mRNA and protein was increased in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and GS Rg1 treatment decreased its expression, suggesting that GS Rg1 may inhibit NF-κB- mediated cardiac inflammation. At the same time, studies have shown that NF-κB transactivation and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated ROS production are mechanisms of inflammatory body initiation and regulation. 23 The NLRP3 pathway affects insulin sensitivity and increases myocardial cytokine levels as well as macrophage infiltration. 24 Moreover, NLRP3 inflammatory bodies regulate downstream inflammatory events of lipotoxicity and glucose toxicity during the development of T2 DM. 25 In the present study, we found that the expression of TLR4, NLRP3 and ASC in the heart of STZ-induced diabetic rats was significantly upregulated, while GS Rg1 reduced the inflammation of the NLRP3 inflammatory body. At the same time, surprisingly, after the combination of CC, we found that CC inhibited the inhibitory effect of GS Rg1 on myocardial inflammation in DM rats mediated by NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammatory neutrophils in an AMPK-dependent manner.
