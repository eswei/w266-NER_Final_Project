 Although BrC displays high mortality and recurrence rate, clinical course is heterogeneous and perfecting disease prognostication might improve patient management. Interestingly, lower PSAT1 promoter methylation independently predicted for worse DFS. The potential of PSAT1 methylation to predict BrC recurrence has been previously reported in early diagnosed luminal-type BrC. Futhermore, a correlation between high PSAT1 methylation levels, on the one hand, and low PSAT1 mRNAs levels and better outcome, on the other, were disclosed [ 14 ]. Interestingly, high PSAT1 expression were associated with poor outcome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 67 ]. These data are in accordance with our findings. Furthermore, high FOXA1 methylation levels independently predicted shorter DSS, a finding that, to best of our knowledge, has not been reported, thus far. Remarkably, FOXA1 expression was previously shown to associate with good prognosis and response to endocrine therapy in BrC patients [ 39 , 40 ], and, thus, promoter methylation is the most likely mechanism underlying FOXA1 downregulation in BrC. In Cohort #1, RASSF1A methylation levels did not show prognostic value, which is in accordance with some previous publications [ 68 , 69 , 70 ]. Nonetheless, other studies have found RASSF1A hypermethylation as a poor prognosis marker in BrC, associating with shorter DFS and DSS [ 9 , 22 , 71 ]. This discrepancy might be due to differences in sample type and methodologies. Because a meta-analysis suggested that RASSF1A methylation is, indeed, associated with worse DFS and DSS [ 72 ], additional studies are needed to definitively establish the prognostic value of RASSF1A promoter methylation in BrC.
