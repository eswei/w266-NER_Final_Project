 miR-146a induced M2 phenotype polarization and up-regulated tumor-associated macrophages expression to regulate breast cancer tumor growth ( 35 ). Our results showed that high glucose increased TNF-Î± and IL-6 expression while reduced IL-10 expression, which was reversed by overexpression of miR-146a. Similar results was observed in another study. Overexpression of miR-146a attenuated the inhibitory effects of NIFK-AS1 M2 phenotype polarization in macrophages, while the expression of IL-10 and Arg-1 were increased ( 36 ). Altered expression of miR-146a in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) underpinned inflammatory senile plaque lesions in AD brains ( 37 , 38 ). miR-146a expression was decreased in DRG cells in hyperglycemia studies of diabetic peripheral neuropathy; cell survival rate was decreased, but this was attenuated by miR-146a mimics ( 39 , 40 ). Rong et al. reported that the expression of miR-146a in plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes was significantly decreased ( 29 ). Our study revealed that the expression of miR-146a was significantly decreased in cell cultures by high glucose and glucose fluctuations, which partially verified that low levels of miR-146a expression were induced by hyperglycemia ( 41 ). Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that miR146a is involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation and plays an important role in various diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we speculated that miR-146a was involved in regulating the polarization transitions of microglia induced by high glucose and glucose fluctuations. Overexpression of miR-146a regulated polarization transitions induced by high glucose and glucose fluctuations promoting M1 to M2 phenotype polarization.
