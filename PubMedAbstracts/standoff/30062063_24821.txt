 Recurrent hotspot somatic mutation in PIK3CA (H1047R) was first identified in PCT PI3KCA H1047R is a recurrent hotspot mutation in human cancers, especially in breast cancers. Although somatic mutations in PIK3CA have been reported in many human cancers ¹⁶ , ¹⁷ , in this study we first identified PIK3CA (H1047) in cardiac tissues (Fig. 5a). To investigate the effect of PIK3CA (H1047R) on activation of protein kinase B/Akt signaling pathway, we tested the phosphorylation of pathway members by western blotting in cardiac tumor tissues. The results showed phosphorylation of AKT at the Thr308 site and GSK-3β at Ser9 site was markedly increased compared to the expression in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 5b). PIK3CA (H1047R) was reported to induce and reactivate multipotency and multi-lineage mammary tumors ¹⁸ , ¹⁹ .
