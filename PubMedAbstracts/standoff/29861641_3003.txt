 Tumor markers play an important role in the early diagnosis and prognosis of gynecological malignancies. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) has been utilized to help predict the presence of malignancy in patients with a pelvic mass. However, the specificity of CA125 in tissues and organs is low; at the same time, it also appears in different degrees of increase in physiological condition (such as pregnancy) and nonmalignant diseases (such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammation, and uterine fibroids). 5 In addition, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are traditional screening criteria for gynecological pelvic malignancies without high specificity. In many gynecological pelvic benign diseases such as inflammation and endometriosis, the levels of CA19-9 and CEA in the serum of pelvic benign tumor patients also increased. 6 Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), a novel tumor marker, is highly expressed in ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer but lowly expressed in adjacent tissues, normal tissues, and benign tumors. As a single tumor marker, HE4 had the highest sensitivity for detecting ovarian cancer. 7
