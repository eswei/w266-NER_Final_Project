 The prevalence of G6PD deficiency is highly relevant to the choice of drug used in anti-malarial treatment [ 7 , 8 ]. A number of drugs, such as primaquine, dapsone, sulfonamides, quinolones, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoins (antibiotics), and phenazopyridine (analgesics), have been described as haemolytic trigger that causes haemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient individuals [ 9 , 10 ]. Primaquine is the recommended treatment drug to eliminate Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites and Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, along with the goal to progress towards zero malaria transmission in Africa [ 11 – 14 ]. It is an ideal agent to be used as primary prophylaxis against P. vivax [ 6 ]. However, primaquine can also induce oxidative stress causing a spectrum of haemolytic anaemia ranging from mild to severe haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals [ 15 ]. The likelihood of developing haemolysis and its severity depends on the level of enzyme deficiency, which in turn is determined by the type of G6PD variant [ 16 – 18 ]. The risk for haemolytic anaemia is particularly high in patients who are treated for P. vivax malaria because they are usually given a higher dose of primaquine (0.25–0.5 mg in a 14-day treatment regime) compared to those treated for P. falciparum (a single dose of 0.25 mg on the first day of treatment) [ 19 ]. A high dose of primaquine (0.5 mg base/kg daily for 14 days) has been previously shown to be more effective than a low dose (0.25 mg base/kg daily for 14 days) in eliminating primary blood infection and preventing relapse episodes in P. vivax patients [ 11 , 20 – 22 ]. However, the lack of G6PD level information, inaccurate methods of screening G6PD deficiency, and the uncertainty in the safety of a single versus long-term primaquine dosage pose risk to malaria patients when treat with primaquine.
