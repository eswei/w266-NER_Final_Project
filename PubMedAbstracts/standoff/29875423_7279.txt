 We additionally identified five patients with pathogenic variations in ARS genes (nomenclature according to Human Genome Variation Society [HGVS] guidelines): P1, female, died at age 4 months, compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in IARS (NM_002161.5): c.1305G>C p.(Trp435Cys) and c.3377dup p.(Asn1126fs) P2, male, now age 5 years, compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in IARS (NM_002161.5): c.1305G>C p.(Trp435Cys) and c.3377dup p.(Asn1126fs). The parents originate from the same region as P1, which may suggest a founder effect for their common pathogenic variation P3, female, now age 5.5 years, compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in LARS (NM_020117.10): c.3420del p.(Ile1141fs) and c.1283C>T p.(Pro428Leu) P4, male, died at age 4 years, compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in KARS (NM_001130089.1): c1732_1744delGGCATTGATCGAG, p.(Gly578SerfsX20) and c.683C>T p.(Pro228Leu) P5, male, now age 4 years, compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in QARS (NM_005051.2): c.2084+2_2084+3del p.(?) and c.793C>T p.(Arg25Cys)
