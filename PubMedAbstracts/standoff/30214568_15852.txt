 Chronic inflammation plays pivotal roles in cancer and autoimmune diseases. We hypothesized that IL-17 and IL-23 may also play important roles in UBC. To verify this, RT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect the expression of IL-23R in tumor tissue and serum of patients with UBC. Results showed that levels of IL-23R and IL-17 mRNAs were higher in tumor tissue than in adjacent tissue. In addition, levels of IL-23R and IL-17 in serum of patients with UBC were also higher than those in normal control group. Correlation analysis suggested that IL-23R and IL-17 protein levels were correlated with clinical stage and lymphatic metastasis. Further Cox hazard model analysis showed that IL-23R and IL-17 may be independent factors for UBC. In addition, protein levels of IL-23R and IL-17 in serum of UBC patients can be used to effectively predict clinical stage and lymphatic metastasis of UBC. The sensitivity and specificity of combined diagnosis using both IL-23R and IL-17 were higher than those of diagnosis using IL-23R or IL-17 alone. In conclusion, we found that IL-23R and IL-17 were upregulated in UBC tumor tissue, and the increased expression levels were associated with poor prognosis. IL-23R and IL-17 may serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic indicators for UBC.
