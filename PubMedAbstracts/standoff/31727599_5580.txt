 LSAMP-AS1, antisense to the mRNA of encoding limbic system-associated membrane protein, is associated with the cellular process of senescence [9] . Notably, the recurrent deletion near the LSAMP locus on the chromosome 3 (3q13.31) is prevalent in PCa malignancies [10] . miR-183 has been highlighted as an oncogene in PCa. Moreover, knockdown of miR-183 was shown to repress growth and motility in PCa cell lines along with reduced tumor growth in vivo by targeting Dkk-3 and SMAD4 [11] . DCN, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a tumor suppressor in PCa. Reduced expression of DCN has been considered as an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with PCa [ 12 , 13 ]. Additionally, Merline et al. suggested that the DCN signaling can attenuate tumor growth by diminishing the abundance of oncogenic miR-21 in cancer [14] . Thus, DCN may interact with other miRNAs to control the behaviors of cancer cells. Although there is a lot of evidence demonstrating the role of lncRNAs in the development of PCa through regulation of miRNAs and mRNAs, the precise mechanism remains to be studied. In the present study, the effects of the LSAMP-AS1/miR-183â€“5p/DCN axis on the progression of PCa were explored.
