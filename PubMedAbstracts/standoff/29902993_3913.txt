 Dyslipidemia has been independently linked with breast cancer development [ 10 ], but studies are conflicting [ 11 ]. Moreover, dyslipidemia is strongly associated with obesity. Recently, patients` body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis was observed to be differently distributed across breast cancer molecular subtypes, and obese women were more likely to have TNBC [ 12 ], also supported by others [ 13 , 14 ]. Of note, obesity has been linked to increased risk of recurrence and breast cancer specific mortality [ 15 , 16 ]. However, a survival study newly demonstrated an association between pre-diagnostic obesity and worse outcome only among patients with Luminal A disease [ 17 ]. Moreover, previous studies have shown inconsistent results on pre-diagnostic obesity and TNBC prognosis [ 18 , 19 ], suggesting there may be other metabolic mechanisms driving the carcinogenesis in more aggressive tumors. Triglycerides serve as an independent source for fatty acid oxidation [ 20 ], an important process promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth [ 21 ], proposing a carcinogenic potential of triglycerides. However, the relationship between pre-diagnostic triglycerides and breast cancer development by molecular subtype remains unclear [ 22 ]. Moreover, cholesterol has been suggested to play a role in breast cancer progression [ 23 ]. Conversely, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol possesses anti-inflammatory properties [ 24 ], and has been inversely associated with breast cancer risk [ 25 ], and suggestively breast cancer survival [ 22 ]. We have previously observed that low HDL-cholesterol may be associated with higher estrogen levels and absolute mammographic density [ 26 â€“ 28 ]. In addition, different lipoprotein subfractions vary by progesterone receptor expression [ 29 ], suggesting the influence of HDL-cholesterol on breast cancer prognosis may differ by breast cancer phenotype [ 30 ].
