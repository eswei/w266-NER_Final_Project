 IL-17 is strictly associated with allergic responses inducing proinflammatory gene expression [ 62 , 63 ], acting alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-1, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), and matrix metalloproteinases [ 64 , 65 , 66 ] through the activation of NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and C/EBP cascades [ 67 ]. Of note, IL-17 was also shown to activate the JAK/STAT and the JAK/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in human airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells [ 68 , 69 ]. Moreover, several studies demonstrated the ability of IL-17 to stabilize the messenger RNA (mRNA) of pro-inflammatory genes by dissociating mRNA splicing factors, thereby prolonging their half-lives and avoiding consequent degradation [ 70 , 71 ]. This interleukin is mainly produced by Th17 cells [ 72 ], but its expression can also be detected in eosinophils [ 73 ], neutrophils [ 74 ], monocytes [ 75 ], macrophages [ 76 , 77 ], and lymphocytes [ 78 , 79 , 80 ]. Of particular interest is that IL-17 was shown to be upregulated in patients with asthma [ 73 ], chronic rhinosinusitis [ 81 ], and COPD [ 82 ].
