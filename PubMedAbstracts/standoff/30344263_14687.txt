 Here, we observed slight deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in rs6323 of ADHD girls and ADHD-C girls (p < 0.05). It is known that a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the case group presents a genetic association with disease [ 37 ]. Thus, it implies the significant role of the rs6323 polymorphism on the occurrence of ADHD in Korean girls. We observed significant differences in the genetic models of MAOA gene rs6323 polymorphism between ADHD girls and control girls (p < 0.05) (Table 2). The frequency of the rs6323 TT genotype was higher in the control girls than in the ADHD girls (ADHD girls: 7.5% and control girls: 20.6%) and the frequencies of the rs6323 genotype and allele in the control girls were consistent with the previous study [ 14 ]. The rs6323 was located in the exon 8 of MAOA gene, which makes an amino acid change from valine to phenylalanine [ 38 ]. It has been reported that the rs6323 gene polymorphism was associated with high (G allele) and low (T allele) MAOA enzyme activity [ 26 ]. Xu et al. (2007) found that the rs6323 G allele frequency was higher in ADHD children when compared to the controls [ 24 ]. Domschke et al. (2005) also observed a significantly increased transmission of rs6323 G allele in ADHD cases [ 39 ]. In particular, the study reported that the increased MAOA enzyme activity led to dopamine deficiency and ADHD. These findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that the imbalance of dopamine levels contribute to the development of ADHD. Therefore, our result implies that the rs6323 TT genotype would be a protective factor against ADHD in Korean girls.
