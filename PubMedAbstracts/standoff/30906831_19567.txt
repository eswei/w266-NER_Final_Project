 The PHD2/HIF-1A pathway in the pathogenesis of hypoxemia and CCHD have been described by many experimental and clinical studies. 14 , 15 Under hypoxic conditions, upregulating the adaptive gene (e.g. VEGF, EPO, and several glycolytic enzymes) by the accumulated HIF-1A protein plays an important role in response to hypoxia, and improves the outcome of CCHD patients. 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 Overexpression of VEGF increases neovascularization and peripheral oxygen delivery, improving hypoxic response in individuals with hypoxemia. 17 , 21 Likewise, EPO maintains oxygen homeostasis by stimulating the proliferation of erythroid progenitors for erythropoiesis under hypoxic conditions. Increased erythrocyte amounts facilitate O₂ transport in response to hypoxia. ²² These evidences demonstrate that overexpression of VEGF and EPO indeed could improve hypoxemia and CCHD prognosis in association with the PHD2/HIF-1A pathway. In this study, compared with wild-type individuals, the c.380G>C group showed a lower hypoxia incidence and a higher collateral vessel formation rate. Angiogenesis is one of the known mechanisms of hypoxia response. The current findings suggested that the c.380G>C mutation might benefit hypoxic response. In in vitro experiments, we found that the c.380G>C mutation increased HIF-1A protein accumulation. In addition VEGF and EPO were upregulated in the c.380G>C mutation group, in association with PHD2/HIF-1A signaling. Overexpression of VEGF and EPO enhances tolerance to hypoxia and improves the outcome of CCHD patients, as elucidated previously. Therefore, our findings suggested that the c.380G>C mutation protects patients with CCHD from hypoxia in association with the PHD2/HIF-1A pathway. This may provide a molecular mechanism for hypoxic response in patients with CCHD.
