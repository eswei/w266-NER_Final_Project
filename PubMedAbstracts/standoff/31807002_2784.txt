 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNAs that bind to the 3ʹ untranslated region (3ʹUTR) of target mRNAs to induce degradation and interfere in the translation process. 4 More and more studies provide evidence to support that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in human cancers and function as tumor suppressors or drivers. 5 – 11 In gliomas, miRNAs are crucial regulators in the tumorigenesis and tumor progression. 12 The expression of miR-708 is down-regulated in glioma tissues and it suppresses the growth and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of glioma cells by targeting sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2)-mediated AKT/β-catenin pathway. 13 miR-4500 functions as a tumor suppressor by attenuating insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) in glioma cells. 14 Our previous study reveals that miR-33a promotes cell proliferation and induces the apoptosis of glioma cells by directly suppressing sirtuin 6 (SIRT6). 15 Recently, miR-769-5p, a newly emerging cancer-associated miRNA, caught our attention. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues, the downregulated expression of miR-769-5p has a hopeful diagnosis potential. 16 The increased expression of let-7d-5p combining with miR-769-5p under-expression indicates poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 17 miR-769-5p expression is frequently reduced in colorectal cancer (CRC), and suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1 (HEY1). 18 , 19 Moreover, miR-769-5p suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by inhibiting transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1). 20 Additionally, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00460 functions as a molecular sponge for miR-769-5p to promote epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and accordingly exerts an oncogenic role in NSCLC. 21 Conversely, miR-769-5p expression is remarkably increased in melanoma and facilitates cancer cell proliferation by targeting glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β). 22 miR-769-5p plays a tumor promoting role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via targeting RING1 and YY1 binding protein (RYBP). 23 However, the role of miR-769-5p in glioma remains unexplored yet.
