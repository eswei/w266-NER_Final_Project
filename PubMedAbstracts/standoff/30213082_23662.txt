 In this study we have demonstrated a potential role by which ω3 FA inhibits the growth and proliferation of pancreas cells including neoplastic and cancer cells. There is a clear association between increased levels of ω3 FA and a strong decrease in the phosphorylation and activation of AKT and its downstream targets, pFOXO3a and pBAD both in vivo and in vitro, where the specific impact of EPA and DHA was determined. The implication of these findings is the potential of a non-metabolic effect of PUFAs on pancreatic cell lines and also in vivo on neoplastic lesions through a mechanism associated with changes in downstream AKT signaling. Previous studies implicated ω3 fatty acids in the negative regulation of the AKT/NF-kB cell survival pathway in breast cancer cells [ 49 ]. Also, ω3 fatty acids induced expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN [ 50 ]. There is one report that demonstrates an indirect means by which the AKT pathway is activated by the metabolism of AA via oxidation and inactivation of PTEN [ 51 ]. Previously, it has been demonstrated that ω3 FAs decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis in cultured pancreas cells (with an opposite effect through ω6 FAs) [ 17 , 20 , 26 , 27 ]. However, there is little information available regarding the mechanism of ω3 FA, particularly through AKT signal suppression likely independent of fatty acid metabolism, which is addressed in this study.
