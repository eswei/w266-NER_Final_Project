 LINC00958 has been shown to play important roles in the development of tumors. For example, Seitz and colleagues investigated the role of LINC00958 in bladder cancer [ 37 ]. They used RNA-sequencing to find aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in bladder cancer. Their data suggested that LINC00958 was upregulated in bladder cancer and knockdown of LINC00958 suppressed cell migration and viability. Silencing of LINC00958 affected resistance to anoikis and invasion. Chen and colleagues showed that LINC00958 was overexpressed in endometrial cancer, and LINC01480 was shown to be required to express the micropeptide [ 40 ]. He and colleagues demonstrated that LINC00958 was upregulated in bladder tumor-associated lymphatic metastasis and lymphangiogenesis [ 41 ]. Ectopic expression of LINC00958 promoted VEGF-C expression by associating with WDR5. However, the expression and functional role of LINC00958 remained unknown. In our study, we first determined the expression of LINC00958 in the degenerative NP samples. We found that LINC00958 expression was upregulated in degenerative NP samples, and LINC00958 expression increased gradually along with the grade of exacerbation of disc degeneration. It is suggested that there is correlation between expression of LINC00958 and low back pain. In addition, we showed that LINC00958 overexpression induced NP cell proliferation, decreased aggrecan and Col II expression and promoted MMP-2 and MMP-13 expression.
