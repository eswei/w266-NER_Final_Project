 The most interesting and novel finding of the current study was that NO level increases with increasing histopathological grading of the tumor [Table 3]. Patel et al.[ 26 ] found the plasma NO level comparable in well to moderately differentiated OSCC but not comparable in poorly differentiated OSCC. The study results showed categorical increase in NO levels with decreased differentiation of tumor. This can be supported by studies carried out by Brennan et al.,[ 27 ] who showed that iNOS expression correlated with severity of dysplasia. Rajendran and Varkey[ 27 28 ] immunohistochemically investigated the expression of iNOS in thirty OSMF samples and correlated it with different grades of epithelial dysplasia associated with the disease. Korde et al.[ 9 ] found increased total NO levels in oral precancer and cancer patients. Biopsies of human mammary tumors showed that there is a greater expression of iNOS in higher tumor grades which tend to be more invasive.[ 29 ] These data support the hypothesis that NO may play a critical role in the growth and spread of tumors.[ 16 ] This study is unique in itself, as this is the first study, according to the best of authorsâ€™ knowledge, ever being conducted to evaluate the NO levels in different histopathological grading of the tumor.
