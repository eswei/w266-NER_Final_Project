 Pathological and molecular features of diffuse gliomas with IDH2 mutations Among the 12 IDH2 mutant gliomas, initial histological diagnosis was oligodendroglioma (grade II) in eight patients, anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III) in three patients, and anaplastic astrocytoma in one patient. Histologically low-grade tumors (grade II) were more frequent than high-grade ones (grade III) among the IDH2-mutant gliomas. Ten patients harbored the IDH2 R172K (c.515G>A) mutation, one patient harbored the IDH2 R172W (c.514A>T) mutation, and one patient harbored the IDH2 R172S (c.516G>T) mutation [Figure 1]. The IDH2 mutations were frequently associated with TERT promoter mutation (9/12, four patients with C228T mutation and five patients with C250T mutation) and 1p/19q co-deletion (11/12), and were negatively associated with loss of ATRX expression (2/12) and p53 overexpression (2/12). Only in one patient, the tumor showed the morphology of anaplastic astrocytoma, harbored IDH2 R172S mutation and also revealed a loss of ATRX expression and p53 overexpression. This patient was diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, WHO grade III. None of the IDH2-mutant gliomas was positive for the H3K27M mutation. Among the ten patients that were available for detecting MGMT promoter methylation, nine patients were found to harbor MGMT promoter methylation [Figure 2]. Figure 1 Representative clinico-neuropathological images of patients with lower-grade gliomas. (A) A patient (No. 9) with IDH2 mutant glioma showed a high-signal space-occupying lesion was on right frontal lobe on axial T2-weighted image of MRI. (B) The oligodendroglioma features of “fried eggs” nucleus and “chicken claw” vessels were observed, and mitotic figures were common (hematoxylin and eosin staining, original magnification ×400). (C–F) Immunohistochemical staining, original magnification ×400; tumor cells were immunopositive for GFAP (C), negative for IDH1 R132H (D) and p53 (E), and immunopositive for ATRX (F). (G and H) The tumor cells were harboring 1p/19q co-deletion detected by FISH (G: 1p loss of heterozygosity, H: 19q loss of heterozygosity; original magnification ×1000). (I and J) Sanger sequencing showed tumors were IDH1 wild-type (I: arrow, IDH1 wild-type) and IDH2 mutation (J: arrow, IDH2 R172K, AGG>AAG). (K) A patient (No. 11) showed IDH2 R172W mutation (Sanger sequencing, arrow, IDH2 R172W, AGG>TGG). (L) A patient (No. 12) showed IDH2 R172S mutation (Sanger sequencing, arrow, IDH2 R172S, AGG>AGT). ATRX: Alpha-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation; FISH: Fluorescence in situ hybridization; GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic protein; IDH: Isocitrate dehydrogenase. Figure 2 Clinical and molecular characteristics of 12 lower-grade gliomas with IDH2 mutation. ATRX: Alpha-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation; H3K27M: Histone H3K27M; IDH: Isocitrate dehydrogenase; MGMT: O⁶-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase; TERT: Telomerase reverse transcriptase.
