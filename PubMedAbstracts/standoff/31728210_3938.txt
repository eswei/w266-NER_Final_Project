 Impaired zinc homeostasis has been observed in various cancers ⁸ . Metadata analyses revealed significantly decreased serum zinc levels in breast, prostate, liver, lung and kidney cancer ⁸ . Alterations in the transcript levels of zinc transporters were previously reported in relation to cancer. For example, overexpression of ZIP6 and ZIP10 has been implicated in breast cancer progression ⁹ . Moreover, downregulation of ZnT5 and ZnT6 mRNA is observed in the early stages of prostate cancer, and ZnT9 mRNA upregulation was observed in stage II of prostate cancer tumors ¹⁰ . Significant upregulation of ZnT1 mRNA was also observed in prostate cancer tissue, independent of tumor stage ¹⁰ . Recently, overexpression of ZnT1 mRNA has been associated with the development and progression of bladder cancer ¹¹ . While dysregulation of zinc transporter expression is observed in cancer, there is no clear evidence that zinc transporter mutations contribute to cancer progression per se.
