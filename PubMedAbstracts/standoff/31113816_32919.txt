 The level of 7α-HCO is normally regarded as a marker for bile acid synthesis. It has been reported that the serum level of 7α-HCO is significantly increased in patients with NASH ( 46 – 48 ). In another study, it was shown that the mRNA expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, was induced in human NASH livers ( 49 ). In partial agreement with a previous study ( 48 ), we found that the level of 7α-HC and its downstream metabolites 7α-HCO, 7α,12α-diHCO, and 7α,27-diHCO were significantly higher in NASH livers, which directly confirmed the upregulation of bile acid synthesis associated with NASH. We also found an increase of 24S-HC and 24R-HC in humans and mice with NASH. 24S-HC is mainly produced in the brain by the enzyme cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), which is expressed in neurons. After enzymatic conversion, 24S-HC is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is metabolized in the liver by the enzyme 24-hydroxycholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP39A1) to 7α,24S-diHC and then to bile acids. To the best of our knowledge, the 24-HC epimers have, so far, not been implicated in NASH. The mechanism of 24-HC accumulation in NASH remains unclear; the most likely explanation for 24S-HC accumulation is decreased downstream metabolism. The origin of 24R-HC is not known, and it is seldom analyzed in MS studies. The level of 7α,24S-diHC is below its detection limit (<5 pg/mg liver), but in future studies we will investigate whether CYP39A1 is downregulated in NASH livers.
