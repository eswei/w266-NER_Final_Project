 Due to ICI’s promising therapeutic effects, most studies have focused on communication between tumor cells and T-cells. However, few studies have been conducted on the tumor cell-intrinsic signaling of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Recent findings ⁶ , ⁷ have reported that a minor subset of patients treated with PD-L1/PD-1 mAb therapy responded with rapid disease progression patterns. One reason for this may be the PD-1/PD-L1 axis-mediated inherent functions in tumor cells and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may affect the tumor cell-intrinsic signaling network, enhancing tumor growth or progress. This suggests that ICI treatment effects may be associated with tumor cell-intrinsic signaling of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Previous studies have demonstrated that PD-L1 and PD-L2 are correlated with multiple tumor phenotypes, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation, and autophagy ⁸ – ¹¹ . The current study indicates that PD-L1 mRNA expression is detected in osteosarcoma ¹² . Metastatic, but not primary, osteosarcoma tumors express PD-L1 ¹³ , ¹⁴ , whereas recent studies show that PD-L1 is detected in primary osteosarcoma, with no significant differences between primary and metastatic osteosarcoma ¹⁵ , ¹⁶ . Moreover, PD-L1 may be correlated with immune suppression, cisplatin resistance, and metastasis-related pathway activation in osteosarcoma by datamining and bioinformatics analyses ¹⁶ . Compared with PD-L1, the functional significance of PD-L2 in tumor cells has been scarcely investigated. To our knowledge, there is no relevant literature reporting on the tumor intrinsic signaling effects of PD-L2 in osteosarcoma.
