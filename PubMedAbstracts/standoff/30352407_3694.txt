 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular taxonomy divides PCC/PGL into four main clusters: pseudohypoxia, Wnt-signaling, kinase-signaling and cortical mixture ( 11 ). The pseudohypoxia group can be divided into at least two subgroups. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related subgroup contains germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunits SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD as well as SDHAF2 (succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2), FH (fumarate hydratase), MDH2 (malate dehydrogenase 2) and GOT2 (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2) ( 12 , 13 ). The VHL/HIF2A-related subgroup shows both somatic and germline mutations ( 13 ). Germline mutations in SDH gene are responsible for 6â€“9% of sporadic PCC/PGLs, 29% of pediatric cases, 38% of malignant tumors and more than 80% of familial aggregations of PGL and PCC ( 14 ). Germline mutations in the SDHB gene are associated with hereditary paraganglioma syndrome type 4 (PGL4), while germline mutations of SDHD are present in hereditary paraganglioma syndrome type 1 (PGL1). The penetrance in SDHB and SDHD mutation-positive non-probands by age 60 years was only 21.8 and 43.2%, respectively ( 15 ). Furthermore, maternal transmission and genomic imprinting in SDHD could mask the hereditary nature of paraganglioma in rare cases ( 16 ). The difficulty of making a precise diagnosis delays appropriate treatment. Thus, hereditary PCC/PGL poses a significant challenge to clinicians.
